<p>Internet addiction as bad as drugs!</p>

<p>Agencies : Washington, Thu Jan 12 2012, 16:21 hrs</p>
<p>Internet addiction disorder may be associated with abnormal white matter structure in the brain and may be as fatal as craving for drugs, researchers say.</p>
<p>Previous studies of Internet addiction disorder (IAD), which is characterized by an individuals inability to control his or her Internet use, have mostly focused on psychological questionnaires.</p>
<p>The current study, on the other hand, uses an MRI technique to investigate specific features of the brain in 18 adolescents suffering from IAD.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by Hao Lei of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, found that IAD is characterized by impairment of white matter fibres connecting brain regions involved in emotional generation and processing, executive attention, decision making, and cognitive control.</p>
<p>They also suggested that IAD may share psychological and neural mechanisms with other types of impulse control disorders and substance addiction.</p>
<p>The study has been published in the online journal PLoS ONE.</p>
