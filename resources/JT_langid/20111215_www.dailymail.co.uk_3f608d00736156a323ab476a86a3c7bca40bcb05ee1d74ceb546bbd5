<p>Call off the search, Mr Perfect does not exist: Poll of 2,000 women failed to find ONE woman who was completely happy with her man</p>

<p>Mr Right? Men leaving nail clippings out is one of the top turn-offs</p>
<p>Ladies searching for Mr Right, look away now. The ‘perfect man’, it seems, does not exist.</p>
<p>While many chaps have positive attributes, the majority are deeply flawed.</p>
<p>In fact, in a study of 2,000 women, most ranked their partner as only 69 per cent perfect.</p>
<p>Included in a list of 20 common shortfalls are failing to make an effort with their partner’s friends, criticising their driving and the inability to multi-task.</p>
<p>Other male failings include leaving the toilet door open, watching too much sport and poor personal grooming.</p>
<p>Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington, which commissioned the study, said: ‘It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner.</p>
<p>‘While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won’t get away with.’</p>
<p>The research found a third of women will turn a blind eye to their man watching too much sport – as long as they listen to them when it counts.</p>
<p>But one in five women is convinced her mischievous partner only pretends to listen to them, while others believe it’s ‘in one ear and out the other’.</p>
<p>Thankfully, one in five would forgive leaving the toilet seat up, while the leniency also stretches to those who don’t help with the cooking.</p>
<p>A quarter of women said dodgy dancing was forgivable, but bugbears such as clothes being left on the bedroom floor and snoring can count against men.</p>
<p>And guys beware: Leaving the toilet dirty, not making an effort with their partner’s family and using her toothbrush are definitely big no-nos.</p>
<p>Leaving out nail clippings, growing a scruffy beard or being too much of a mummy’s boy are other sure fire ways to guarantee ‘imperfection’.</p>
<p>More...</p>
<p>Female bosses are better! Women more tolerant of staff checking Facebook or doing personal chores in office hours</p>
<p>Working mothers are HAPPIER than stay-at-home mums, study reveals</p>
<p>When asked what would make the perfect man, a good personality came top, followed by a sense of humour and looks.</p>
<p>Miss McReynolds said: ‘The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference.’</p>
<p>TOP 20 IMPERFECTIONS IN MEN...</p>
<p>1. Not getting on with her family</p>
<p>2. Using her toothbrush</p>
<p>3. Leaving the toilet dirty</p>
<p>4. Hating her friends</p>
<p>5. Not being good with children</p>
<p>6. Being lazy</p>
<p>7. Having a big bushy beard that you never shave</p>
<p>8. Leaves nail clippings out</p>
<p>9. Driving like a boy racer</p>
<p>10. Being grumpy</p>
<p>11. Being a mummy's boy</p>
<p>12. Using the toilet with the door open</p>
<p>13. Leaving dirty washing on the floor</p>
<p>14. Unkempt facial hair</p>
<p>15. Criticising her driving</p>
<p>16. Burping or farting</p>
<p>17. Not liking dogs</p>
<p>18. Not helping with washing up</p>
<p>19. Watching too much sport</p>
<p>20. Not helping with the cooking</p>
