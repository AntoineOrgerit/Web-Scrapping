<p>Boring office environments make workers hit the booze</p>
<p>A boring office environment is likely to see staff reaching for the booze, new research has found.</p>
<p>Bored staff are heading for the booze (Picture: Stock)</p>
<p>Work drudgery was well documented in The Office but chronic boredom could have you reaching for the chocolate bar – or even the bottle.</p>
<p>Office tedium is a worry for a quarter of staff who comfort eat at work and booze afterwards.</p>
<p>Half of the 102 workers in a study by the University of Central Lancashire made mistakes out of boredom.</p>
<p>‘Managers might consider using boredom proneness as a tool when selecting staff,’ said researcher Dr Sandi Mann.</p>
<p>'My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping.</p>
<p>'This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling and empowerment. Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens.'</p>
