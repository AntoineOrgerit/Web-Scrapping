<p>Vancouver’s free-booze lounge ‘would be members only,’ offer counselling</p>

<p>Rob Morgan, a spokesman for a VANDU spin off group that is planning to open a lounge where registered members can drop in for access to free vodka, sherry and beer.</p>

<p>A group from Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside is lobbying for the latest frontier in harm reduction measures: free alcohol, served in a peer-run drinker’s lounge.</p>
<p>The Eastside Illicit Drinkers Group for Education says it wants to reduce the harmful impact of addicts ingesting cheap, illicit alcohol, and see this as the next step in Vancouver’s harm reduction movement best demonstrated by the Insite heroin injection site.</p>
<p>Spokesman Rob Morgan says the drinker’s lounge would offer counselling, health and detox referral services, and the group would maintain a database to monitor outcomes.</p>

<p>“It would be members only because once word gets out it is free alcohol, everyone that just wants a free drink would show up,” he said.</p>
<p>But critics say that harm-reduction strategies continue to prop up addicts and simply continue the cycle of addiction. “Drug users don’t want to deal with complex issues, and politicians are looking for an easy answer to a complex issue,” says David Burner, executive director of the Drug Prevention Network of Canada, a lobbying group for prevention and abstinence treatment of alcohol and drug addiction.</p>
<p>“[Harm-management treatment strategies] says it’s OK, it’s not your fault that you’re a drunk, it’s not your fault that you’ve chosen to drink every day. It’s not your fault and it’s not your choice, you’re caught up in this.”</p>
<p>But doctors who administer similar programs say harm-management may be the only way to approach chronic alcoholism, and say a walk-in lounge may be an important place to continue their efforts.</p>
<p>“If it was possible to get every addict to quit, then of course it would be cheaper, but that’s simply not feasible,” says Dr. Tim Stockwell, the Director of the Centre for Addiction Research of British Columbia (CARBC).</p>
<p>Dr. Stockwell and his team are currently conducting an eight-patient pilot project in Vancouver, which has ben running since August. The program, and similar programs in Toronto and Ottawa, offer one drink an hour to participants.</p>
<p>Mr. Burner argues free drinks don’t encourage alcoholics to get clean.</p>
<p>“We appreciate that you don’t want to do hard work, we’re going to give you something to keep you maintained,” Dr. Burner says. “The rubby who is drinking hair lotion on the street, sure, why not give him a lounge? It’s ludicrous. You don’t know whether to laugh or cry.”</p>
<p>Dr. Stockwell said the risk of poisoning and death ‘‘increases so much’’ when it is Listerine, hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol that is being consumed.</p>
<p>“This is a humane response to their addiction, an incredibly valuable approach that can save lives and reduce the costs of emergency services involved in alcohol related calls,” he says. “Our major objective is not so much to make people quit, but to have them healthier and save lives.”</p>
<p>Dr. Stockwell said the pilot projects may set a template for future addiction therapy.</p>
<p>“[In British Columbia] there’s such a readiness to accept and embrace the need for harm reduction for people with drug problems,” he says. “It seems to be a small step, an easier step with alcohol because it’s a legal drug and we hope to implement some of the strategies we’ve used here elsewhere.”</p>
<p>But Mr. Burner says the public should not be burdened by the addictions of a minority.</p>
<p>“Will everybody make it? No, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to them,” he says “But I don’t want my tax dollars going to give people free drugs.”</p>
