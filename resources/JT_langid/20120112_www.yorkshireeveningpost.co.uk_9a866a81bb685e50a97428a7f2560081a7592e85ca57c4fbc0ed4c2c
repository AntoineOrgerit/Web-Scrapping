<p>Leeds woman has controversial PIP breast implants removed</p>
<p>Kate Ward who has had her PIP breast implants removed.</p>
<p>By Katie Baldwin Published on Thursday 12 January 2012 08:51</p>
<p>A woman has spoken of the fears which led her to have her controversial PIP breast implants removed.</p>
<p>Kate Ward decided to have the surgery over worries that the French-made implants could rupture.</p>
<p>She spent thousands having them replaced at a Leeds private hospital earlier this week - when they were found to be leaking.</p>
<p>Now she is hoping for redress through legal action against the firm which carried out her original surgery.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old told the YEP: “I just feel really relieved.</p>
<p>“Now I’m very determined to get justice, not just for me but everybody in the same situation.”</p>
<p>Women have been panicked by the scandal affecting implants made by French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which were banned last year after they were found to contain non-medical grade silicone.</p>
<p>Ms Ward, from Methley, Leeds, had her breast enlargement in 2005 because of “body image” issues.</p>
<p>She had the procedure done by the Harley Medical Group at a clinic in Yorkshire, going from a B to a DD cup.</p>
<p>In April 2010, she heard about concerns over PIP implants and went for a consultation with her original surgeon.</p>
<p>However the mum to 10-year-old Logan was left dissatisfied and contacted solicitors Hugh James, which is representing 700 women with PIP implants, joining their legal case.</p>
<p>Through her GP, she saw specialists on the NHS and decided to have her implants replaced.</p>
<p>As the NHS will only pay for removal of PIP implants if they were put in privately, Ms Ward spent around £5,000 on having them replaced at the Nuffield Hospital in Leeds.</p>
<p>Surgeon Philip Turton found that about 4 per cent of the gel in the implants had “bled” out.</p>
<p>“There are no health implications for me because they managed to remove everything,” Ms Ward said.</p>
<p>“But in general it’s hard to say because the gel migrates and they don’t know how long its going to take to travel.</p>
<p>“They don’t know exactly how it will affect women but it could have a negative effect.”</p>
<p>Harley Medical Group said yesterday they would not replace PIP implants free of charge.</p>
<p>The firm declined to comment on Ms Ward’s case.</p>
