<p>Britons are fighting a losing battle against the bulge with more than a quarter of men and women classed as clinically obese for the first time.</p>
<p>Today's report from the NHS Information Centre revealed that 26 per cent of men and women were obese in 2010. This has increased from 13 per cent of men and 16 per cent of women in 1993.</p>
<p>The number of overweight and obese men and women and obese-only men and women has gradually increased since 1993</p>
<p>Only one in three men are now a 'normal weight' with 68 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women classed as overweight or obese. This was calculated by combining each person's body mass index with their waist circumference.</p>

<p>Obesity crisis in schools: How one child in three is too fat by the age of 11</p>
<p>Overall, 16 per cent of men and 17 per cent of women have also been diagnosed with asthma.</p>
<p>Obesity can cause a number of health problems including type 2 diabetes and heart disease</p>
<p>The bleak figures follow a report from the National Child Measurement Programme that found one one child in three is overweight when they leave primary school at the age of 11.</p>
<p>Almost a fifth are classed as obese, meaning they are so fat they risk knocking years off their lives.</p>
<p>And the number of ten and 11-year-olds who fall into this category has risen by nearly 10 per cent in just four years, according to NHS data.</p>
<p>The only improvement was seen among reception children, with the number of obese four and five years old dropping from 9.8 per cent in 2009 to 9.4 per cent in 2010.</p>
<p>Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told Mail Online: 'Any encouragement having read yesterday's toddler obesity improvement has gone out of the window!</p>
<p>'To-day's figures simply confirm the worst and illustrate how laughable government attempts have been to keep Britain from being the fattest nation in Europe.</p>
<p>Men aged 55 to 64 were the most likely to be overweight or obese (82%)</p>
<p>'The comparison with 1993 is very apt: one has to remember that the government at the time targeted to reduce UK adult obesity to "seven per cent or less" by the turn of the century!</p>
<p>'Each successive Minister for Health has been more incompetent than the previous appointee and more or less ensured that we have the disasterous figures we have today.'</p>
