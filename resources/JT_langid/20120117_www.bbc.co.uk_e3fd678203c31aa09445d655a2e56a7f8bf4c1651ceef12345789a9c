<p>Norovirus closes ward in Bedford</p>
<p>All wards, except critical treatment units, at a Bedfordshire hospital have been closed to visitors to prevent the spread of winter sickness.</p>
<p>Luton and Dunstable Hospital introduced the measure to protect patients and public from the norovirus bug.</p>
<p>"This condition causes vomiting and diarrhoea," a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The hospital is also asking the public to only to come to A&E if it is a real emergency and to bring only one other person with them.</p>
<p>Visitors will be allowed only into wards where a patient is critically ill and these include such places as the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>"We expect the ban on visitors to last for 24-48 hours," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"Patients on five of our wards have been affected and they are closed to new admissions to help avoid the spread of infection.</p>
<p>"If members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease please do not come to A&E."</p>
<p>The virus has to run it course over two or three days as there is no cure.</p>
<p>The hospital advises those stricken with the condition to stay indoors, isolate themselves from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated.</p>
