<p>A reduction in training places for nurses in London is "deeply concerning", the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned.</p>
<p>NHS London is cutting the number of trainee nurses from 2,000 to 1,580 a year.</p>
<p>The organisation claims the change will allow it to raise standards of teaching.</p>
<p>But the RCN warned of the possibility of "chronic shortages" of nurses, with staff poached from abroad.</p>
<p>RCN chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: "We are deeply concerned at this reduction in nurse training places.</p>
<p>"The nursing workforce has grown in recent years, but only just enough to keep up with rising demands on healthcare.</p>
<p>"It is vital to avoid a return to the chronic shortages of the early 1990s and the old boom-and-bust cycle of NHS workforce planning."</p>
<p>'Wasted investment'</p>
<p>He continued: "NHS London needs to produce a robust plan guaranteeing continued investment in nurse training and education.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of newly qualified nurses are dedicated professionals, who are committed to providing the highest possible standards of patient care.</p>
<p>"Having the right numbers and mix of healthcare professionals is pivotal in enabling these nurses to provide this high quality care."</p>
<p>Dr Anne Rainsberry of NHS London said: "Figures show that if we continue to train the same number of adult nurses as we currently do, there will soon be more trained nurses than there are jobs available.</p>
<p>"This would leave graduates out of work and waste the taxpayers' investment in their training.</p>
<p>"By reducing the number of training places for adult nurses next year, we can invest in training more nurses where London really needs them - like increasing the number of health visitors and children's nurses working in the capital."</p>
