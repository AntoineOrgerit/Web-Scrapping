<p>An image of the inside of the oesophagus after the application of a fluorescent dye. When viewed under fluorescence with an endoscope, areas of cancerous cells are seen as purple against the green background of the normal cells.</p>
<p>Cancer detecting dye could âsave many livesâ</p>
<p>Tuesday, January 17, 2012 1:19 PM</p>
<p>A FLUORESCENT dye that pinpoints the tiniest sign of cancer when sprayed onto the oesophagus (the food pipe) could detect the disease earlier - potentially saving many lives, Cambridge scientists have discovered.</p>

<p>The Hutchison/MRC Research Centre (alternative view), where the MRC Cancer Cell Unit is located.</p>
<p>Oesophageal cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK. Around 8,000 people a year are diagnosed with it.</p>
<p>The number of men diagnosed with it has risen by more than 50 per cent in a generation.</p>
<p>The research, conducted at the Medical Research Council Cell Unit in Cambridge, in collaboration with Cancer Research UKâs Cambridge Research Institute, shows when sprayed onto the oesophagus the dye sticks to normal, healthy, cells but not to cancer cells or those in the early stages of turning cancerous. This gives an early warning of where the cancer is developing and can spare patients radical surgery.</p>
<p>At this point the cancer can be treated with radiofrequency ablation â an electrical current applied to the affected area to kill the cancer cells.</p>
<p>Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald, lead author based at the MRC Cancer Cell Unit in Cambridge, said: âCurrent methods to screen for oesophageal cancer are controversial â they are costly, uncomfortable for the patient and are not completely accurate. Our technique highlights the exact position of a developing oesophageal cancer, and how advanced it is, giving a more accurate picture.â</p>
<p>Professor Kevin Brindle, a researcher at Cancer Research UKâs Cambridge Research Institute, said: âThe benefit of using this dye is that it is specific, relatively cheap and is found in our normal diets so unlikely to cause any unwanted effects at the levels we use. We now need to test our technique in newly diagnosed patients.â</p>
<p>Dr Julie Sharp, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: âOesophageal cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect and treat, with only eight per cent of people with the disease surviving at least five years. We urgently need new ways to detect the cancer earlier, and this dye offers a great opportunity to treat the cancer more promptly and more successfully, potentially saving many lives a year.â</p>
