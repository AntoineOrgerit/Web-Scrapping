<p>Lansley criticises private companies for refusing to replace breast implants</p>

<p>Private medical companies refusing to replace the banned PIP breast implants free of charge should "step up to their responsibilities", the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, has said.</p>
<p>He said a review of private cosmetic surgery would look at how firms insured against their liabilities after the scandal, which broke in France last month.</p>
<p>Lansley told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the NHS would be able to help where there was a clinical need. He said women were right to be worried about the implants but insisted they did not need "urgent" medical attention.</p>
<p>The health secretary added: "I am not happy about private providers not stepping up to their responsibilities at all.</p>
<p>"I think the argument that they somehow can't afford to do so begs the question: where was their insurance? Where were they insuring themselves against their liabilities?</p>
<p>"I think their ability to meet their liabilities to their patients should be one of the issues we look at."</p>
<p>Lansley's comments came as the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said the government had to make sure private providers met their "moral obligation" to the women affected.</p>
<p>He said: "What I want to initiate is cross-party discussions about how we can not only change the law for the future, but how in any way we can make a difference now to the women affected, even through legislation or other means, to force those companies to face up to their responsibilities.</p>
<p>"We must leave no stone unturned in making those companies be held to account. That's what I want to see and I hope we can do that on a cross-party basis."</p>
<p>On Saturday, 60 women marched on The Harley Medical Group and the Transform offices in London after they refused to replace free of charge the implants they had fitted.</p>
<p>The government has also launched a national press advertising campaign this weekend advising women what to do if they have the implants.</p>
<p>Adverts are appearing in national newspapers and will be featured on websites from Monday, while GP surgeries and other parts of the NHS will be urged to display them.</p>
<p>The advice reiterates the government's view that there is no evidence to support routine removal of the implants unless women have symptoms such as pain and tenderness.</p>
<p>It stresses that experts have found no link with cancer and there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of harm compared with other brands of breast implants.</p>
<p>Around 40,000 women in the UK received PIP implants manufactured by the now-closed French company Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP).</p>
<p>The implants were filled with non-medical grade silicone intended for use in mattresses.</p>
