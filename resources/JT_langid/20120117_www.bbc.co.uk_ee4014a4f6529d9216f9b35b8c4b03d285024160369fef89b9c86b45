<p>Outpatient shocked by $45m bill from New York hospital</p>
<p>The billing company has said the error is a simple mistake but will send apology letters to all affected</p>
<p>An outpatient is recovering from shock after being billed $44.8m (£29.2m) in error by a New York hospital.</p>
<p>Alexis Rodriguez, 28, was one of a number of patients charged astronomical amounts because of a computer glitch, the New York Daily News reports.</p>
<p>The Bronx-Lebanon Hospital treated him for pneumonia, but the actual cost was no more than $300.</p>
<p>Billing firm PHY Services said it had mistakenly printed the patient invoice number where the amount should go.</p>
<p>Mr Rodriguez told the New York Daily News he could not believe his eyes when he opened the envelope last week.</p>
<p>"I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out," said the unemployed doorman.</p>
<p>"To send out a lot of bills with numbers that big - someone could have had a heart attack."</p>
<p>PHY Services requested that patients ignore the bills, adding that new ones would be sent out.</p>
