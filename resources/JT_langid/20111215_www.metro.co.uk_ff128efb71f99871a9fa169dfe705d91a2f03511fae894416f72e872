<p>Burger boy Thomas Miller back from the brink after deadly E.coli scare</p>

<p>A boy of five has recovered from 12 brain operations, kidney and liver failure, paralysis and blindness after catching a deadly strain of E.coli – from a burger.</p>
<p>Happy family: Thomas, centre, is looking forward to spending Christmas with his brothers, 12-year-old Richard, left, and James, nine (Picture: Caters)</p>
<p>Thomas Miller is the only person in Britain to have survived the rare strain of the bug and is one of only four in the world to have beaten it.</p>
<p>His horrified parents, Joanna and Andrew, were told he was unlikely to survive after the strain spread to his brain – a case not seen in Britain for 20 years, forcing doctors to contact specialists in Canada.</p>
<p>But two years on Thomas is ‘just like any other boy’ and looking forward to Christmas at home.</p>
<p>The youngster, who was two-years-old at the time, fell ill just 24 hours after eating a beef burger on a family day out in Scotland in 2009.</p>
<p>His older brother James, then seven, suffered diarrhoea and a day later Thomas started to pass blood.</p>
<p>‘We just didn’t know what was happening. It was frightening,’ said 37-year-old Mrs Miller, from Aspatria, Cumbria. ‘He went for an operation that day and had to have dialysis.</p>
<p>‘He was holding his head and screaming, he couldn’t move and was as stiff as a board.’</p>
<p>The E.coli had entered Thomas’ bloodstream but further scans revealed it was also attacking his brain.</p>
<p>Two golf ball-sized abscesses on his brain, which had caused him to go blind, were drained in August 2009 – allowing him to see again.</p>
<p>But his ordeal wasn’t over as he developed more abscesses on the brain and even suffered an allergic reaction to the medication, which ‘burned’ his skin.</p>
<p>Finally last year, after having all the abscesses removed, he was given the all clear. ‘I’ll never forget the day he came out of intensive care,’ said Mrs Miller. ‘It’s only really this year that I’ve been able to relax.’</p>
