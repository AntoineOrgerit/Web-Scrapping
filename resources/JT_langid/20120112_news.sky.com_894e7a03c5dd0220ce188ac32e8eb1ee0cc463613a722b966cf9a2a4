<p>6:50pm UK, Wednesday January 11, 2012</p>
<p>The Health Secretary has announced a new review into all cosmetic procedures, including breast implants and dermal fillers.</p>
<p>It will look at how quality and safety in the industry can be improved and better regulated.</p>
<p>NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh will lead the review, prompted by concerns clinics are not collecting data properly.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley told Sky News the review could open a "Pandora's box" but said he would rather tackle the issue proactively instead of waiting for problems to develop later.</p>
<p>Andrew Lansley says the NHS should not pay if patients had PIP implants privately</p>
<p>"I am going to make sure we cast the net widely," he said.</p>
<p>"This is not just important for us in the wake of the breast implant scandal from France... We want to make it a proactive opportunity to look at safety."</p>
<p>He said the move should not be interpreted as an attack on the industry.</p>
<p>"I hope they will see it... as a real opportunity to get rigorous standard-setting and reporting," Mr Lansley said.</p>
<p>It follows significant fears some silicone implants could be at risk of rupture after French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was closed down for using materials designed for use in mattresses.</p>
<p>Around 40,000 women in Britain are believed to be affected and many wish to get the silicone removed.</p>
<p>However, there has been a mixed response from the cosmetic surgery industry. The Harvey Medical Group, for example, has said it will not replace PIP implants free of charge.</p>
<p>In Parliament earlier, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the Government had let down women who feared their implants were unsafe.</p>
<p>Many of those who had the operations privately have struggled to gain access to their medical records, have faced lengthy delays or "hit a brick wall", he said.</p>
<p>Mr Lansley said the NHS would be there for women who find their private clinic refuses to remove faulty implants.</p>
<p>The Poly Implant Prothese implants that sparked concern</p>
<p>"Any NHS service in this instance would only cover the removal of the implant, it would not include the replacement of private cosmetic implants," he said.</p>
<p>"In these cases the Government would pursue private clinics to seek recovery of our costs."</p>
<p>Mr Lansley said it would not be fair for the taxpayer "to foot the bill" for patients who went private.</p>
<p>When the review into all procedures was announced, Sir Bruce said his priority was to ensure the safety of people who undergo cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of practitioners in the cosmetic industry are professional and well skilled - but I'm concerned that the sector as a whole does not have the systems for monitoring the results for patients and alerting us to possible problems.</p>
<p>"I will work with the industry to improve regulation and governance and increase consumer confidence," he added.</p>
<p>Market analysts Mintel estimates that in 2010 there were 101,904 surgical procedures and 1,250,919 non-surgical procedures carried out in the UK.</p>
<p>But this does not include privately-held "botox parties".</p>
<p>The same year the market was worth £2.3bn and is expected to grow to £3.6bn in 2015.</p>
