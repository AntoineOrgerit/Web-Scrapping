<p> 'Childhood poverty remains a reality in India' </p>

<p> By IANS, </p>
<p> New Delhi: Despite India developing as a major economy, the country's children have a bleak future due to malnutrition leading to stunted growth, high school dropout rates and poverty, a report said Wednesday. </p>
<p> "The Impact of Growth on Childhood Poverty in Andhra Pradesh" was conducted by NGO-Young Lives from 2002 and has collected data on 2,011 children aged between six to 18 months and 1,008 children aged between 7-and-half to 8-and-half years. </p>
<p> Findings from its third round of data collection were released here Wednesday. </p>
<p> "We chose Andhra Pradesh because it is a forward looking state and moreover its not about the percentages but the trends that reflect the whole of India," Young Lives India director Renu Singh told IANS. </p>
<p> "The findings reflect the state of childhood poverty across the country," she added Singh. </p>
<p> According to the study, despite falling poverty, considerable economic growth and the development of significant policies, two-fifths of the world's malnourished children live in India. </p>
<p> "A third of children surveyed are stunted, which has serious long-term implications for health, psychosocial well-being and educational achievement," said Singh. </p>
<p> "The research also shows that despite higher enrolment, drop-out and school quality remain critical issues," she added. </p>
<p> On the government highlighting nutrition as a key policy concern in the upcoming Twelfth Five-Year Plan, Singh said that the focus given to poor nutrition is welcome but calls for a multi-sectoral approach. </p>
<p> She further said that by age 15, only 75 percent of children are in school. </p>
<p> "Improving the impact of education for children, however, requires improving the quality of schools as well as retaining children in school, and ensuring that other pressures - including poverty - do not undermine children's ability to learn," said Singh. </p>
