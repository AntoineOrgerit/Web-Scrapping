<p> SIMPLE JAB THAT COULD CURE BRITAINS OBESITY CRISIS </p>
<p> A simple once-a-day fat-busting jab could be the key to battling ­Britains obesity crisis </p>
<p> Wednesday January 11,2012 </p>
<p> By Jo Willey </p>
<p> Have your say(5) </p>
<p> A SIMPLE once-a-day fat-busting jab could be the key to battling ­Britains obesity crisis. </p>
<p> In trials of the drug, patients have lost at least half a stone (7lb). One apparently shed up to four stone after taking the treatment. </p>
<p> Injections of the hormone can also cut blood pressure and cholesterol levels. </p>
<p> One obesity expert hailed the ground-breaking findings as ­potentially revolutionary. </p>
<p> Doctors already use it to treat diabetics. The hormone, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is secreted from the intestine when we eat and is the bodys natural way of ­suppressing appetite. </p>
<p> People taking it feel less hungry and it is already used in Britain to treat type 2 diabetes because of its ability to regulate blood sugar levels. </p>
<p> Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: These new injections really have the potential for revolutionising treatment. Safety-wise they are pretty good. I am using them on my patients and have had a lot of ­success. For some they have been dramatically successful, with one losing about four stone and having blood sugar under control for the first time ever. </p>
<p> Modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes </p>
<p> Professor Raj Padwal, of the ­University of Alberta, in an accompanying BMJ editorial </p>
<p> Researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark analysed the results of 25 trials involving more than 6,000 patients to assess the effect of GLP-1 on weight loss, blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzyme levels, as well as blood sugar control. </p>
<p> They found that patients given a daily dose for at least 20 weeks achieved weight loss of half a stone. </p>
<p> However, common side-effects included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. But researchers say it did not appear to affect the numbers dropping out of the trials, suggesting that overall patient ­satisfaction with the treatment is relatively high. </p>
<p> Professor Tina Vilsboll, who led the research published in the ­British Medical Journal, said: Our analysis provides convincing ­evidence that GLP-1 chemicals, when given to obese patients with or without diabetes, result in ­clinically relevant beneficial effects on body weight. </p>

<p> Additional beneficial effects on blood pressure and total cholesterol might also be achieved. </p>
<p> The researchers believe that the treatment should be considered in patients with diabetes who are obese or overweight. </p>
<p> Professor Raj Padwal, of the ­University of Alberta, in an accompanying BMJ editorial, said: ­Modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> OBESITY! </p>
<p> 11.01.12, 11:44pm </p>
<p> Whatever happened to good old-fashioned personal responsibility, and self-discipline? </p>
<p> One accepts that there is a small percentage of obese people who have a specific medical problem. However, the vast majority simply don't seem capable of stopping stuffing their faces as they lounge in front of a TV screen. Many of those whom I know are even doing it at my expense (they talk about 'benefits'; I talk about 'taxes'!!). </p>

<p> Enough of this clinical trials. Let us get on with the real action. I see so many obese in my Town they would be happy to have this cure willingly saving taxpayers lot of money on benefits given to these poor people? </p>

<p> PREVENTION IS SURELY BETTER THAN A CURE IN THIS CASE </p>
<p> 11.01.12, 8:55am </p>
<p> Once again time and money has been spent researching a solution to a problem that with better education wouldn't exist. </p>
<p> Healthy eating, regular exercise and the opportunity for your body to do what it does naturally will get better more sustainable results. </p>
<p> This is a lazy solution for lazy people. </p>

<p> AND I HAD BTHOUGHT THAT THE HEADLINE MEANT.. </p>

<p> a jab of truth. Alas, that is not to be for a while yet. </p>
<p> The truth isthat it i8s the carbs that fatten. Digested carbs first top-up liver and muscle glycogen stiores, the rest rapidly converts to bodyfat in the cells mitochondria via the Krebs and citric acid cycles. Fruit`s fructose converts directly to9 bnodyfat in the liver.digested fats only slowly convert to useable nergy molecules in the liver. </p>
<p> howver, that5 info9 is taboo. dieticdians mUST follow thier big brother Assn, te US one. That one is, unfortunately for the ehalths eeker, funded by producers of foodst5uffs, of food procyts, b\\ofb beverages, of confections, of fast foods, by a giant biotech company, and ibnduitrecftly by big pharma. thios clearly shows why they6 stick t9o falose 1970s dogam. </p>
<p> The raeson we are staurated with the saturated fat and calories nonsense is so that big pharma can market their useless and highly tos\\xin statins, to combat a non diseaswe condition. If the dieticians had advised all to eat the healthgiving butter, egg yolks, and red and organ meats with their fat, then ibn the next bereath they woould nOT be able to sell you their to9xic statin drugs. </p>

<p> http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/11/28/are-statin-drugs-harmful-to-health.aspx </p>
<p> Honest guidance for losing bodyfat would be to greatly reduce the carbohydrates, carbs intake. To eat most of the daily carbs at breakfast, and to eat no carbs after 5pm.To zero all sugars, Be VERY wary of high fructose corn syrup, the KILLER!! (Sugar has 70+ harmful health effects), and, minimise refined grains. </p>
<p> Also do the Peak 8 cardio 3 times a weeki, that taking only 20 minutes each time. . Mercola R, Dr., 2011. </p>
<p> That advice is the sinplest jab to start your way to slim, ,robust, med-free health. </p>
<p> Needle jabs can also give you mercury, aspartame, aluminium etc, and maybe a few live viruses, as well as any as yet unknown side effects from the medication. </p>
<p> You have free will. Choose your path. </p>
