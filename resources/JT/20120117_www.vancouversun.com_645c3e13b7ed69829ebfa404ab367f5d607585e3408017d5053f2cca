<p> If youâre having trouble reading this because your head is pounding from too many drinks last night, help may be on the way. </p>
<p> Of course, youâll have to wait until scientists perfect their theory. </p>
<p> Researchers have uncovered a compound in an ancient Chinese herbal medicine that has been found to stop hangovers and to reduce alcohol dependency in rats, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. </p>
<p> If the compound is proven to have the same effect in humans, it could help pave the way to a cure for alcoholism, said Dr. Jing Liang, the studyâs lead author and an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of California in Los Angeles, in an interview with Postmedia News. </p>
<p> For others who enjoy an occasional drink but would rather not endure the pounding hangover headache the next day, taking the compound also could be âan easy way to erase the uncomfortable feelings,â said Liang. </p>
<p> Hovenia is an extract from the Chinese Raisin Tree. </p>
<p> In Asia, Liang said hovenia has been taken as an herbal supplement to treat hangovers for at least 500 years. </p>
<p> However, the effectiveness of hovenia as a drug to treat alcohol dependency has never before been closely studied. </p>
<p> Liang said she became interested in taking a closer look at hovenia when she noticed that when people consumed alcohol along with food cooked with hovenia â as it is also a spice used for cooking in Asia â they seemed to avoid getting drunk. </p>
<p> In order to study how hovenia works, Liang said she needed to isolate the specific compound that was blocking the effect of alcohol. </p>
<p> The answer turned out to be dihydromyricetin, or DHM. </p>
<p> Liang and her research team at UCLA began testing the compound on rats. </p>
<p> They devised a series of tests to determine what would happen to rats if they were given just alcohol, or alcohol along with DHM. </p>
<p> For the group given alcohol, the ratsâ behaviour when intoxicated was not unlike that of humans, she said. </p>
<p> When you give a rat alcohol, they act âtotally like a human,â said Liang. âYou give an animal alcohol and then theyâre drunk, and they lose consciousness. They go to sleep.â </p>
<p> But the rats who were given alcohol plus DHM, showed no signs of intoxication, Liang said. </p>
<p> âThey donât (get) drunk,â said Liang. âIt was amazing. I was so excited.â </p>
<p> The rats in the alcohol group slept for about 70 minutes, while those in the DHM group only slept for about 10 minutes. Others didnât sleep at all, she said. </p>
<p> In another test, the researchers administered DHM to rats who were given alcohol for a prolonged period of time. Their symptoms of alcohol dependency were significantly reduced. </p>
<p> âFrom this experiment, even if you establish a high drinking level of alcohol and then give them DHM, their dependence will reduce,â said Liang. </p>
<p> The rats given DHM along with alcohol did not have any hangover symptoms either, she said. </p>
<p> The next step, if she is able to secure enough funding, is to test the studyâs findings in human clinical trials, said Liang. </p>
<p> She expects to see the same results in humans, and without any negative side effects. </p>
<p> âFor more than 500 years (that hovenia has been used as a supplement), there have been no reports of poison or toxicity,â she said. âItâs really safe.â </p>
<p> Liangâs goal is to turn DHM into a medication, possibly in a gum, patch or spray-form, she said. She already has patented her idea. </p>
<p> Alcohol-use disorders are a major public-health problem around the world, said Liang. </p>
<p> In her study, she wrote that there are only three medications â oral naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram â currently approved for treating alcohol dependence by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. </p>
<p> However, Liang said these drugs have major side-effects and have not been proven effective in treating the disorders. </p>
<p> Bernard Le Foll, a pharmacology professor at the University of Toronto, said the studyâs findings are âvery promisingâ for the treatment of alcohol addiction. </p>
<p> âI think itâs very interesting,â he told Postmedia News. âItâs building on the use of an old plant in Chinese medicine and they seem to have been able to isolate what seems to be the active ingredient.â </p>
<p> However, Le Foll does not recommend people start taking hovenia to treat their hangovers just yet. </p>
<p> âMore experiments need to be done. We need to validate this in human subjects,â he said. âBut what is clear from this experiment is that . . . some drugs appear to accelerate the elimination of alcohol from the body, and also it seems to reduce the desire to drink alcohol.â </p>
