<p> KEN GIGLIOTTI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Crews begin demolition work at the Misericordia Health Complex Wednesday. </p>
<p> DEMOLITION work began Wednesday at the Misericordia Health Complex, the start of a $43-million development. </p>
<p> A 2,272-kilogram wrecking ball was used to cave in the roof of a 106-year-old building, the Maryland South building. </p>
<p> The redevelopment will take place in two phases. </p>
<p> Phase one involves replacing the demolished Maryland South building with a two-storey complex that will accommodate the Buhler Eye Centre -- the largest facility of its kind in Western Canada -- and the new University of Manitoba Ophthalmology residency program. </p>
<p> The complex's ambulatory diagnostic centre will relocate from the fourth floor to be closer to Urgent Care and Ambulatory Care. </p>
<p> The new complex will house PRIME, a new day health centre for the elderly. </p>
<p> Work in the first phase is expected to be completed in 2013. </p>
<p> The second phase of the redevelopment will include demolition of the Sherbrook building and replacing it with a new chapel and spacious front entrance and two-storey glass-walled atrium </p>
<p> Wednesday's demolition was unexpectedly interrupted when the wrecking ball became wedged in the upper floors of the structure and came loose. </p>
<p> Hospital officials said the wrecking ball was reattached and demolition crews were back to work by noon. </p>
<p> George Vincent, project superintendent, said it will take about seven weeks to completely demolish the building and clean up the site. </p>
