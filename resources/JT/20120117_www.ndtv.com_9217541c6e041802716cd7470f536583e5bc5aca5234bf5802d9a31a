<p> Hospital mistakenly bills patients for millions </p>
<p> Associated Press, Updated: January 17, 2012 10:55 IST </p>
<p> New York: Patients at a New York City hospital are getting billed for tens of millions of dollars because of a computer error. </p>
<p> Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez says he almost became ill when he received a $44.8 million bill from the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. </p>
<p> Rodriguez tells the New York Daily News (http://nydn.us/AjolYU )that he was hospitalized last spring with pneumonia and was afraid the bill was legit. </p>
<p> Turns out the company that prepares the bills had mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount should go. </p>
<p> The billing company is telling patients to ignore the multimillion-dollar bills. It says it will send out corrected ones. </p>
<p> The hospital didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday, which is a holiday. </p>
