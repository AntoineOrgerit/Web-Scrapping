<p> Stroke and atrial fibrillation study, New England Journal of Medicine </p>
<p> (Note:CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) </p>
<p> An irregular heartbeat that isn't felt but is detected by a pacemaker may point to an increased risk of stroke, a new study suggests. </p>
<p> The study in Wednesday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 2, 580 people aged 65 or older with hypertension and no history of a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial tachyarrhythmia. That's a heart that races to more than 190 beats per minute. Pacemaker investigator Dr. Stuart Connolly and his co-authors wanted to see if silent but ast heart rates might explain some strokes.(Scott Gardner/Hamilton Spectator/Canadian Press) </p>
<p> Dr. Jeff Healey and Dr. Stuart Connolly of McMaster University in Hamilton, and their co-authors were interested in exploring possible reasons for the quarter of strokes that currently have no known cause. </p>
<p> "This study suggests that silent atrial fibrillation is very common and may be the cause of many strokes that previously could not be explained," Healey said. "In all, atrial fibrillation may be responsible for nearly one in five strokes." </p>
<p> In the study, participants in 23 countries who'd had a pacemaker implanted were followed for an average of 2 ½ years. </p>
<p> In that time, 11 of the 261 patients or 4.2 per cent had a subclinical or silent atrial fibrillation detected by their pacemaker within three months and had an ischemic stroke or a serious heart complication called systematic embolism, the researchers found. </p>
<p> The silent heart problem was also detected at least once during the follow-up time in nearly 35 per cent of people. </p>
<p> Silent atrial tachyarrhythmias increased the risk of ischemic stroke or systematic embolism by 2.5 times, after taking into account other risk factors such as age, sex, previous strokes and history of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, Healey's team concluded. </p>
<p> The study was funded by pacemaker manufacturer St. Jude's Medical. Several authors said they'd received fees from pacemaker and defibrillator makers. </p>
