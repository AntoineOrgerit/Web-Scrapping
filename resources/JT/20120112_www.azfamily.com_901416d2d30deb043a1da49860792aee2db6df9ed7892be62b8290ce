<p> Is the hCG Diet Right for You? </p>
<p> What is hCG Weight Loss Diet? hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the substance almost completely controls the woman’s metabolic functions. Generally, the hCG used in the diet protocols, is synthetic. </p>
<p> How much weight will I lose with the hCG Weight Loss Diet? This all natural weight loss program is helping people lose up to a pound per day, with many losing over 30 pounds each month! Factors that guarantee faster weight loss include increasing fresh vegetable intake and keeping hydrated by drinking lots of water. </p>
<p> What preparations are required for hCG Weight Loss shots? Prior to treatment, our physician will require current CBC, CMP, and TSH blood tests. If you do not have current blood work, our lab accepts most insurance and will provide the series at discounted $60 (includes $10 for the blood draw) for our clients. </p>
<p> Is it healthy to lose 1 to 2 pounds a day with hCG Weight Loss Diet? hCG Weight Loss Diet studies have shown that weight lost following the Simeons protocol comes directly from adipose fat tissue rather than lean muscle. This means that the weight lost comes directly from fat. The hCG Diet does not strip the body of much needed muscle, vitamins or minerals essential to maintain good health. hCG Weight Loss dieters report a feeling and appearance of great health and marvel at the loss of negative health risks they had as an overweight individual. </p>
<p> Why the 500 calorie diet – VLCD (very low calorie diet )? hCG Weight Loss Diet shots cause your hypothalamus to mobilize the fat out of the fat storage locations so that it’s available for use. While you are only consuming 500 calories, your hypothalamus is continually releasing the fat stored in your body. Because of this, your body is actually operating on thousands of calories a day. The result is your body using thousands of calories of fat from your body each day, the reason HCG Weight Loss dieters lose 1 to 2 lbs of fat or more, per day. </p>
<p> Will I be hungry on 500 calories a day? It is common for mild hunger during the first few days, however this will pass and by the 2nd week, you will find even very tiny servings, to be completely satisfying. This is partly due to your hypothalamus adjusting your metabolic rate, but largely due to the amount of calories circulating in your system from the fat being released. It is common that Hormone dieters feel as though they are stuffing themselves in order to reach that 500 calorie limit! </p>
<p> Who is a candidate for hCG Weight Loss Diet Shots? The majority of men and women can use hCG Weight Loss Diet injections for weight loss. Those who are pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant, nursing, or who have ever had any hormone-related cancer are not good candidates. </p>
<p> How about safety and side effects of hCG Weight Loss Shots? There are rarely side effects reported while using hCG Weight Loss Diet shots (injections), or oral hCG drops for weight loss. When the hCG hormone shots (injections) are used for fertility reasons, the larger amount is known to cause occasional headaches, and pregnancy symptoms. However, the amount differences between the hCG Weight Loss Diet protocol and hCG Hormone used for fertility purposes is significantly different in quantity. </p>
<p> Will I gain the weight back after the HCG Weight Loss Diet? After the hCG Weight Loss Diet, you will find your appetite has changed, your eating behavior will be changed and your body will of course, have changed. This is the perfect opportunity to adopt that healthy lifestyle to maintain your weight. You will find a minimum amount of exercise will be sufficient for maintaining a very healthy body- from yoga, to 15 minutes of cardio a day, or whatever you enjoy, that gets your heart moving. With your hypothalamus reset, your metabolism will be different and you will be able to eat moderately without feeling the need to overeat. </p>
<p> What is the hypothalamus gland? The hypothalamus gland moderates the thyroid, adrenals, fat storage, and more importantly, your metabolic rate. </p>
<p> Is hCG Weight Loss Diet safe for men? The HCG Weight Loss Diet used for the Hormone weight loss protocol is actually already found in men. In fact, it is present in every human tissue, including males and non-pregnant women as well as pregnant. </p>
