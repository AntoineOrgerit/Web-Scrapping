<p> Falklands turns away cruise ship </p>
<p> (UKPA) – 15 hours ago </p>
<p> Princess Cruises says it is surprised and disappointed that the Falkland Islands government turned away its Star Princess ship. </p>
<p> The ship had planned to dock in Port Stanley on a cruise from Chile to Brazil, with stops in Argentina. </p>
<p> Many Argentines are among the 3,500 passengers and crew. </p>
<p> The cruise comes as Argentina and Britain engage in a diplomatic row over the islands Argentina calls the Malvinas. </p>
<p> Falklands government spokesman Darren Christie said they had to deny entry because some passengers had stomach flu and the islands are ill-equipped to handle a contagious virus. </p>
<p> But Princess Cruises said the decision was unwarranted and unscientific and runs against international health policy. </p>
<p> Hundreds died when Britain drove out occupying Argentine forces in 1982. </p>
