<p> Lives of pupils with asthma ‘put at risk by inhaler rules’ </p>
<p> By SHÂN ROSS Published on Thursday 12 January 2012 12:27 </p>
<p> THOUSANDS of children with asthma across Scotland face difficulty accessing lifesaving inhalers during emergencies at school due to needless red tape, a health charity said today. </p>
<p> Asthma UK said schools are prevented from keeping a spare inhaler on their premises because they are prescription-only medicines. But this puts children’s lives at risk when they have forgotten their own inhaler or have run out, it said. </p>
<p> The charity is calling for a change in the rules to allow schools to keep inhalers in their first aid kits. </p>
<p> On average, two children in every class in the UK have asthma – meaning there are 72,000 children in Scotland relying on inhalers to keep them well. </p>
<p> Scotland also has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the world, although the exact reason for this is unknown. Approximately 100 Scots die from asthma each year, despite the fact that 90 per cent of deaths are thought to be preventable with the right care. </p>
<p> The charity said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) could provide an exemption to the regulations to allow schools to supply the inhalers. </p>
<p> Similar exemptions already exist for organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and the armed forces. </p>
<p> A survey by the charity of children with asthma from across the UK aged between five and 18 found almost two-thirds have had an asthma attack at school. </p>
<p> One in five children with asthma said they find it “quite difficult” or “very difficult” to access their inhaler at school, and more than half (55 per cent) said they do not always know where their inhaler is or how to get it. </p>
<p> About 64 per cent of children with asthma have at some point been unable to access a working reliever inhaler in school, having either forgotten, lost, broken or run out of their own. </p>
<p> Gordon Brown, national director of Asthma UK Scotland, said: “These medicines are very safe but going without them can be very dangerous, so it is crucial that the MHRA changes the rules and allows schools to keep a spare inhaler as a last resort. </p>
<p> “The majority of children know to find a teacher if they don’t have their own inhaler when having an asthma attack at school, but the reality is there is very little that staff can legally do to help. This puts children at risk.” </p>
<p> A spokesman for the MHRA said: “In the interests of patient safety, asthma inhalers should only be supplied on prescription to the individual named, for his or her own use. </p>
<p> “The MHRA has no plans to change the current legal position.” </p>

<p> Surely if schools are 'prevented from keeping a spare inhaler on the premises because they are prescription only medicines' therein lies the solution? Simple question - why can't the child retain hisher own inhaler whilst at school? It's not as if they are liely to start chucking it about the class or squirting other kids with it for fun, is it? It fits in a pocket, or a schoolbag, and is there when needed. The important word being 'needed.' </p>

<p> No.2, if that's all you can think of then you have serious imagination deficit! It has been shown that the rise of asthma and allergies is linked to several phenomena which are supposed to make our lives easier and more comfortable: Car exhausts pumping out particulates, benzene, etc into the air. Central heating and double glazing leading to poorly ventilated homes and perfect warm, moist conditions for dust mites, various moulds, and so on. Consumption of highly processed foods and added preservatives, flavourings, leading to nutritional imbalance in kids, vitamin deficiencies, obesity. Generally sedentary lifestyles and lack of physical exercise with kids plonked in front of telly, computer, games console instead of running about outside, cycling to friends... </p>

<p> # Fuely - Strangely true that there were fewer asthmatics in days gone by. I recall only two throughout my entire schooldays, and this was in small town rural Scotland which also had its fair share of smoke-belching mills and other factories. One sufferer, an old friend, squarely blamed both her chain fag-smoking parents and live-in pipe-smoking granda. One factor in the present trend you neglected to mention - the huge surge in road traffic and its consequent fallout, especially that from diesel-fume-spewing buses and other HGVs. </p>

<p> And further to that perhaps I should point out that in bygone days kids were out in the streets playing and getting fresh air rather than sitting in the smoke filled house playing on their computers! </p>

<p> #2 Fuel Head, think about it the other way, due to the ban on smoking in other places mebbe many more parents are now smoking at home in front of their kids and the kids are suffering from the effects of secondary inhilation possibly causing more asthma? Just a thought! </p>

<p> How come that when I was at school, we probably had about two kids with asthma in the entire school, yet these days you get two in each class? Either the diagnosis of asthma is the easy cop-out for doctors to absolve them from blame from not "treating" whinging kids (and parents)... or, the population is getting weaker as time goes on... or, asthma is on the increase, in which case we have to look at what might be causing it. The most obvious thing that springs to mind is the decline in tobacco smoke in recent times. Exposure to tobacco smoke is about the only thing I can think of that has decreased in line with cases of asthma increasing. Think about it... </p>

<p> Schools Should be like second homes, and have access to all our sick Children's Needs, Our "More than our Jobs Worth" Brigade are more than dangerously ridiculous, in banning prescription-only medicines,, Would they rather see a Child Die in front of them because of their Utter Stupid Ways! </p>
