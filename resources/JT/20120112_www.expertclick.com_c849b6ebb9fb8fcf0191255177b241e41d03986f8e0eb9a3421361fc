<p> In a still shaky economy it is vital we all get as productive as possible, thus it makes it all the more important that those New Year's Resolutions regarding weight loss, health and fitness. Over a year ago Dr. Mayer Eisenstein, a Chicago based physician who is also the author of a number books on vaccine safety, lost over 100 pounds on the Metabolic HCG Diet, and his energy level and ability to work longer, harder and better skyrocketed in the aftermath. </p>
<p> Eisenstein says the HCG journey "was the most incredible of all the medical journeys have taken, and I have taken quite a few" His webinars, many on vaccine and quite a few on HCG, can be accessed at his website, www.HomeFirst.com Click on the Webinars button to get in to the archives and see the upcoming webinars, which this month are Vitamin D on January 15 and Vaccines on January 29. A long-time opponent of mass vaccination, Dr. Eisenstein's most recent book is Make an Informed Vaccine Decision for the Health of Your Child: A Parent's Guide to Childhood Shots. </p>
<p> In the February 2011 OC Gazette Magazine, which had Dr. Eisenstein on the cover, they reported that "after trying almost every diet out there with varying degrees of success, Dr. Eisenstein, along with his wife and daughter, started the Metabolic HCG Diet and the results have been astonishing. Dr. Eisenstein has lost 114 pounds, has had normal blood pressure for the last 10 months, is off his medication, and no longer has chronic back pain. His wife Karen has lost 71 pounds and her pre-diabetic symptoms have vanished. His daughter Jen, a nurse practitioner, weighed 222 pounds, had been overweight since second grade, and had chronic knee problems she attributed to a motorcycle accident. After six months on the Metabolic HCG Diet, she lost 62 pounds and went from a size 16 to a size 8. The knee problems she thought were due to the motorcycle accident were gone, and she realized the pain was actually due to the fact that she was overweight" </p>
<p> During one archived webinar he shows pictures of himself at about 350 pounds and the aftermath and before and after pictures of his wife Karen before her 70 pound loss on the HCG Diet. He told listeners he had 20 people at his clinic on the Metabolic HCG Diet who had lost over 100 pounds, an incredible statistic. He is amazed not only at the weight loss but at their ability to keep the weight off. Questions can be asked during the live webinars and they have proved to be very popular. </p>

<p> It is no secret that weight gain is one of the issues that plagues men and women as they age and approach peri-menopause, menopause, and andropause (male menopause). This is one of the most challenging situations people face and even the most educated and successful individuals are often hung up by this one thing that they can't seem to get under control: weight gain. "The Metabolic HCG Diet is a wonderful program because it is a roadmap to regaining optimum health and losing weight safely and effectively" </p>
<p> According to Dr. Eisenstein, the Metabolic HCG Diet is about more than just weight loss. Many patients (including himself) who complete the program have also experienced other health benefits, including lowered cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. "Studies have shown that maintaining healthy levels in these four areas- blood pressure, bad cholesterol, central obesity (belly fat), and blood sugar (insulin resistance) - increases life expectancy while decreasing the incidence of heart disease and stroke" </p>
<p> We use a combination of nutraceuticals and Prescription HCG to help patients not only lose weight, but also learn how to eat right to keep the weight off. </p>
<p> This professionally supervised medical weight loss protocol is working for me, my family and my patients. I would be happy to help YOU on your weight loss journey. </p>
