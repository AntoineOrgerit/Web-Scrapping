<p> $17.5M fix on the way for Misericordia </p>
<p> A section of the Misericordia Health Centre in Winnipeg met up with a 5,000-pound wrecking ball on Wednesday. </p>
<p> But it was Mother Nature that provided the initial beating. The freezing weather caused the crane hydraulics to act up, seizing the equipment. Workers had to use a torch to heat it up to get it moving again. </p>
<p> Then the wrecking ball fell off inside the building. No one was hurt and it was finally reattached but the work was significantly delayed through the morning. </p>
<p> The century-old Maryland South building is being demolished as part of the $43-million redevelopment project. </p>
<p> A new two-storey health complex will be constructed in its place. </p>
<p> When the work is complete, Misericordia will be home to the province's eye care "centre of excellence" and will also house a new diagnostic imaging centre, a chronic care unit, a sleep lab clinic and renal dialysis centre </p>
<p> The centre will also introduce a "program of integrated managed-care for the elderly," or PRIME, that will combine medical and nursing care with leisure activities and family respite. </p>
