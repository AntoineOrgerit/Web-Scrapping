<p> VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 11 (UPI) -- An advocacy group in Canada is calling for government funding to provide alcoholics with free alcohol to curb the drinking of hand sanitizer and mouthwash. </p>
<p> The proposal is from Vancouver's Eastside Illicit Drinkers Group for Education, which was formed in July and received a $52,000 grant to research alcohol maintenance programs in British Columbia. </p>
<p> Spokesman Rob Morgan said he is among thousands of alcoholics who buy and drink hand sanitizer stolen from hospitals, and also drink mouthwash or rubbing alcohol, The (Vancouver) Province reported. </p>
<p> Vancouver already has centers where heroin addicts can inject with safe syringes and Morgan said the time has come to give the same protection to alcoholics, </p>
<p> "It would be members-only because once word gets out it is free alcohol everyone that just wants a free drink would show up," he told the newspaper. </p>
<p> Preliminary estimates show it would cost about $350 per month per drinker, but the group maintains that would be cheaper than the costs of emergency medical treatment for people drinking unsafe alcohol. </p>
<p> A proposed drinker's lounge would be stocked with vodka, sherry and high-alcohol beer, Morgan said. </p>
