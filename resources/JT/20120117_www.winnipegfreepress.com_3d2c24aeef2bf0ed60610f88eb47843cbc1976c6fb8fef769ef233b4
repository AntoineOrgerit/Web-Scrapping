<p> An average of 230 Manitobans try to quit smoking every day. This week, their odds of quitting are better than ever. </p>
<p> It's National Non-Smoking Week and the Canadian Cancer Society has rolled out a new initiative called Break It Off to help young smokers kick the habit before they cause further damage to themselves. </p>
<p> "The big thing is the website, BreakItOff.ca," said CCS tobacco advocacy co-ordinator Will Cooke. "This was done in conjunction with Health Canada and is aimed at a younger demographic." </p>
<p> "Right now the highest smoking rate in Manitoba is among young people. We wanted to create a tool that is relevant to that age group." </p>
<p> Break It Off aims to get smokers to view their relationship with cigarettes as extremely unhealthy and encourages them to "break up" with their addiction. </p>
<p> "There are a lot of cool features young adults can use on the site," Cooke said. "You can even end your relationship with smoking publicly with a status update on Facebook." </p>
<p> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, a "public breakup" with smoking can greatly increase the chances of success. </p>
<p> "People successfully quit smoking in many ways and we have all sorts of tools to help them improve their chance of success," said Cooke in a media release. "It's all about helping people quit and improving their odds of staying tobacco-free." </p>
<p> The CCS also offers their Smokers' Helpline to help all Manitobans cope with the difficulties in quitting smoking. </p>
<p> "Medication like Champix can help, but another thing that helps people quit is getting telephone counselling," said Cooke. </p>
<p> Manitoba continues to have one of the highest smoking rates in Canada with about one in five Manitobans lighting up. </p>
<p> Benefits of butting out worth the effort </p>
<p> According to the Canadian Cancer Society, smokers feel pretty lousy after their initial 'breakup' with cigarettes. But here are the benefits you can expect after: </p>
<p> Eight hours: Increased oxygen in your system and lower blood pressure may have you feeling like a heavy weight is being lifted. </p>
<p> One day: Your lungs should be working better, leaving you out of breath a lot less often. </p>
<p> Two days: Your sense of taste and smell should be making a pleasant return. </p>
<p> One week: Increased blood flow to your hands and feet should have you feeling a lot less cold. </p>
<p> Four weeks: As your lung function continues to improve, physical activity should be quite a bit easier. </p>
<p> Six weeks: You should notice less coughing, sinus congestion and shortness of breath. </p>
<p> One year: Your risk of coronary heart disease is about half that of an average smoker. </p>
<p> Three years: Your risk of heart attack is similar to someone who has never smoked. </p>
<p> Five years: You have reduced your risk of getting cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, bladder, kidney and pancreas. </p>
