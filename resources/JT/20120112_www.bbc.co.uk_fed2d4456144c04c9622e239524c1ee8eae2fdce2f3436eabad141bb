<p> Hospitals in England must do much better at improving productivity if patient care is not going to suffer in the coming years, experts say. </p>
<p> The NHS has been told to make £20bn of savings by 2015 - a saving of about 4% a year. </p>
<p> The report by the Nuffield Trust think tank highlighted a host of areas where productivity gains could be made. </p>
<p> These included cutting lengths of stay, doing more day case surgery and improving the way goods are bought. </p>
<p> Savings could also be made in back-office functions, such as HR and finance, while staffing - which accounts for about 70% of costs - also needs to be looked at. </p>
<p> The report said it was important to get the skill mixes right and to limit the use of agency staff and overtime, while trying to tackle sickness rates. </p>
<p> It said only by tackling these issues could the NHS "reduce the need for cutbacks in services for patients". </p>
<p> 'Very difficult' </p>
<p> The NHS budget is being increased over the next four years - but only by an average of 0.1% a year. </p>

<p> Improving hospital productivity </p>
<p> Length of stay - Latest data shows that patients spend 7.2 days in hospital on average - higher than the international average and twice the figure in Denmark. Improving discharge arrangements, particularly at weekends, would make a big difference </p>
<p> Day case surgery - Everything from hernia repairs and cataract operations to ear, nose and throat surgery can be done as a day case. But again the NHS is lagging behind international best practice </p>
<p> Back-office functions - By standardising and simplifying practices in areas such as HR, finance and IT, £600m could be saved from the £2.8m annual bill </p>
<p> Staffing - Money could be saved through reducing reliance on agency staff and overtime as well as tackling sickness rates through better occupational health </p>
<p> Procurement - The fragmented way basic goods, from gloves to paper, are bought means many places are over paying. About £500m a year - 10% of the consumables bill - could be saved if all trusts bought at the lowest available price </p>
<p> And because costs are rising at a higher rate than this, due to factors such as the ageing population and cost of new drugs, the health service is having to make the £20bn of savings. </p>
<p> The Nuffield Trust said this was presenting a major challenge because productivity had been getting worse over the past decade. </p>
<p> It focused on hospitals because they are the most expensive part of the NHS system, accounting for about £45bn a year - nearly half the entire budget. </p>
<p> The think-tank compared hospital performance against international data as well as taking an in-depth look at how six trusts had turnaround performance. </p>
<p> Judith Smith, head of policy at the Nuffield Trust, said: "It is very difficult to justify cuts if inefficiencies in areas such as rates of day case surgery, length of stay and the purchasing of hospital supplies remain untackled. </p>
<p> "The financial challenge facing the NHS will concentrate minds, but much more needs to be done. </p>
<p> "Why, when so much is known about what drives and can improve efficiency, has hospital productivity deteriorated?" </p>
<p> David Stout, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the Nuffield Trust was "absolutely right" to flag up the need to improve productivity. </p>
<p> "The NHS has a lot to do if it is going to meet the financial challenge it faces and time is running out." </p>
<p> Health minister Simon Burns added: "We agree the NHS should and can be more efficient and improve the quality of its services at the same time." </p>
