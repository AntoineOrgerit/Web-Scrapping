<p> Sir Elton John will write a book on the AIDS epidemic. Picture: AFP PHOTO Source: news.com.au </p>
<p> ELTON John is writing his first book, which will ask why more isn't being done to fight the AIDS crisis. </p>
<p> The musician says Love is the Cure: Ending the Global AIDS Epidemic will include memories of friends who died of AIDS-related illnesses, including Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. </p>
<p> British publisher Hodder & Stoughton says the book will be published in July along with an audio book read by the British pop star. </p>
<p> Proceeds will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation. </p>
<p> John said on Monday the book would ask why more was not being done to cure the disease. </p>
<p> He said AIDS "is a disease that must be cured not by a miraculous vaccine, but by changing hearts and minds, and through a collective effort to break down social barriers". </p>
