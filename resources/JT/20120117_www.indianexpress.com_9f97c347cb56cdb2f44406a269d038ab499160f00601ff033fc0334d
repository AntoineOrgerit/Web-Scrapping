<p> Eating from a red plate could help you to lose weight </p>
<p> Share| </p>
<p> Agencies : London, Mon Jan 16 2012, 14:12 hrs </p>
<p> Serving up meals on red plates or drinking from red cups cuts consumption by about 40 per cent, scientists have found. </p>
<p> German and Swiss academics behind the discovery say the colour red may encourage diners to avoid snacking because it is commonly associated with the idea of danger, prohibition and stop, a media report said. </p>
<p> They claim the discovery means the government and food industry could use red packaging on unhealthy foods as a deterrent  and could even use more red in pubs to prevent people drinking too much, they claimed. </p>
<p> In the study, 41 male students were asked to drink tea from cups marked with red or blue labels. They drank 44 per cent less from cups with red labels. </p>
<p> In the second part of the study, 109 people were given ten pretzels each on either a red, blue or white plate. Those with a red plate ate fewer pretzels. </p>
<p> Red may be associated with alarm or something primeval, said Ursula Arens, from the British Dietetic Association. </p>
<p> The results were published in the journal Appetite. </p>
