<p> CHICAGO — The chief executive of the </p>
<p> Walgreen Company </p>
<p> defended the chain’s decision to end its relationship with the prescription benefit manager </p>
<p> Express Scripts </p>
<p> , even as rivals have stepped up their efforts to attract pharmacy customers covered by Express Scripts plans. </p>

<p> Speaking to about 2,500 shareholders at the Walgreen annual meeting, the executive, Gregory D. Wasson said that Express Scripts was offering to pay below-average rates, which was unacceptable to Walgreen. The agreement ended Dec. 31. </p>
<p> “We believe the long-term implications of accepting Express Scripts’ below-market proposal would have been much worse than the short-term impact on earnings,” Mr. Wasson said to a packed ballroom at Navy Pier. “We are moving on. We are not going to remain in a world Express Scripts wants us to stay in.” </p>
<p> Express Scripts and Walgreen have been battling over payment issues for months, setting off a decline in Walgreen’s share price of about 25 percent since the dispute became public in June. The price of Walgreen shares dipped 1 percent, or 39 cents, on Wednesday, closing at $34.01. </p>
<p> Analysts estimate Walgreen could lose more than $4 billion in annual revenue from the end of the Express Scripts deal. </p>
<p> Walgreen filled more than 80 million </p>
<p> prescriptions </p>
<p> managed by Express Scripts in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31. If it lost them all, Walgreen’s total prescription volume for fiscal 2012, which began Sept. 1, 2011, would most likely drop 1 to 3 percent, compared to growth of about 9 percent a year for the last decade. Walgreen stores filled 819 million prescriptions in fiscal 2011. </p>
<p> Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., is the nation’s largest pharmacy chain with more than 8,200 outlets in the United States operating under the Walgreen’s and Duane Reade names. </p>
<p> A spokesman for Express Scripts said the company remained open to having Walgreen in its network, “but only at rates and terms that are right for our clients and in line with other pharmacies in our network.” </p>
<p> Most Walgreen customers with an Express Scripts plan are expected to switch to another pharmacy to maintain better coverage and pay less for drugs. </p>
<p> But Kermit R. Crawford, a Walgreen president, told reporters after the meeting that a record 200,000 customers had already taken advantage of a special discount the company offered this month on membership in its prescription savings club. </p>
<p> For the month of January, Walgreen lowered the discount club’s price to $5 a year for individuals and $10 for families. Normally, membership is $20 a year for individuals and $35 for families. </p>
<p> In the meantime, competing pharmacies have taken to the airwaves, the Internet and print media, to promote their acceptance of Express Scripts’ drug cards. Last weekend, for example, CVS ran an advertisement in 49 million of its circulars distributed in newspapers and other publications, and it plans to run a similar ad this weekend. </p>
<p> CVS has the opportunity to pick up 20 million prescriptions in 2012, potentially adding $175 million to $235 million in incremental operating profit, said a spokesman, Michael J. DeAngelis. </p>
<p> At the shareholder meeting, one shareholder wondered whether Walgreen was putting itself in danger, since Express Scripts is seeking to buy Medco Health Solutions, another leading pharmacy benefit manager. </p>
<p> Mr. Wasson said he was uncertain how the proposed $29 billion merger would affect Walgreen. However, he said the chain would not do business with the combined company if the rates Express Scripts proposed were adopted by the larger company. </p>
<p> The Express Scripts-Medco deal has raised antitrust concerns, and the Federal Trade Commission is still deciding whether to approve it. </p>
