<p> Predators 				Pick Prey that Balances Their Diet </p>
<p> Thursday, January 12, 2012 </p>
<p> University researchers have 				debunked the dogma that predators aren't picky eaters, with a new 				study finding predator animals that are given a choice of foods 				will select a diet that maximizes their chances of reproducing. </p>
<p> The researchers, including 				Professor Stephen Simpson, an internationally renowned biologist 				from the University of Sydney, have shown for the first time that 				predatory animals choose their food on the basis of its 				nutritional value rather than just overall calorie content. </p>
<p> The findings, published in the 				Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday 11 January, are 				based on a study of the ground beetle, Anchomenus dorsalis, a 				garden insect that feasts on slugs, aphids, moths, beetle larvae 				and ants. </p>
<p> The international team of 				scientists from the University of Sydney, the universities of 				Exeter and Oxford in the UK, Aarhus University in Denmark and 				Massey University in New Zealand, collected female beetles from 				the wild and split them into two groups in the laboratory. </p>
<p> Half of the beetles were 				offered a choice of foods - some that were high in protein and 				some that were high in fat. The other half were not given a 				choice of foods: some of these beetles were only given high 				protein food, while the rest were just given high fat foods. </p>
<p> The beetles that were given a 				choice of foods ate the proportions of protein and fat that were 				optimal for producing healthy eggs. These beetles produced more 				eggs than the other beetles in the study that had no choice of 				foods. </p>
<p> "Contrary to standard 				dogma, predators do balance their diet and show nutritional 				wisdom," said Professor Simpson, an ARC Laureate Fellow in 				the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney and 				the paper's senior author. </p>
<p> "Although we previously 				demonstrated this characteristic in spiders, predatory beetles, 				fish, mink and cats, this is the first study to show the adaptive 				reasons and benefits of diet selection," Professor Simpson 				said. </p>
<p> The finding could have 				implications for predator killing and eating patterns in 				particular environments, with important consequences for food 				webs and ecological communities, said Professor Simpson. </p>
<p> "Immediately after winter 				hibernation, when both predators and the prey are likely to have 				depleted fat stores, predators are likely to kill and eat more 				prey than if the prey were rich in fats. Conversely, if some prey 				species contain a higher concentration of fats than is optimal 				for the predator, then predators should switch their focus 				towards more protein-rich prey species." </p>
<p> Previous research on insects 				has shown that herbivores such as butterfly larvae and 				grasshoppers, and omnivores such as fruit flies and crickets, 				select food to give them a balanced diet. This is the first 				research to show that predators also select food on the basis of 				nutritional value. </p>
<p> Lead researcher Dr Kim Jensen 				of the University of Exeter said: "At a time of year when 				many of us are focused on healthy eating, it is interesting to 				see that predators are also selective about what they eat. </p>
<p> "Biologists have 				previously assumed that predators cannot afford to be fussy and 				are simply focused on getting the right quantity of food, rather 				than quality. We show for the first time that they do actually 				select the foods that will give them the right balance of 				nutrients." </p>
