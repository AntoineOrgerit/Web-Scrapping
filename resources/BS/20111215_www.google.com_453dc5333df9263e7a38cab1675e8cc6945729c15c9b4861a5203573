<p> The General Medical Council (GMC) is to issue guidance on how to deal with complaints against doctors who may have assisted in suicides. </p>
<p> Case examiners and the regulator's investigation committee will be advised about what action to take over allegations that doctors have helped people to die. There will be a public consultation on the draft guidance once it is published in January. </p>
<p> It follows a patient asking the GMC what advice or support, if any, doctors could give to patients who were considering ending their lives. </p>
<p> Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: "The issue of assisted suicide is complex and sensitive. We already have clear guidance for doctors that they must always act within the law and assisting or encouraging suicide remains a criminal offence. This guidance will not in any way change the legal position for doctors. </p>
<p> "We recognise, however, that there are a range of actions which could be considered as assisting in a suicide, such as providing information to a patient about suicide or providing practical assistance for someone to travel to a clinic such as Dignitas. </p>
<p> "Some of these actions may not lead to criminal charges but may still lead to complaints to us about a doctor's fitness to practise." </p>
<p> The guidance will include factors that might be relevant in determining the seriousness of each case. It will not cover euthanasia -in which a doctor's actions lead to a patient's death - as this is already covered by existing guidance. </p>
<p> In the last decade, the GMC has examined three cases where a doctor was said to have helped somebody to die. </p>
<p> One resulted from a conviction for assisting suicide in Canada and none from any conviction in the UK. </p>
