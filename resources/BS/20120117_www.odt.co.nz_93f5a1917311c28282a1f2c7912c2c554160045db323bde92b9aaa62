<p> Dunedin </p>
<p> By </p>
<p> Eileen Goodwin </p>
<p> on Tue, 17 Jan 2012 </p>
<p> News: Dunedin </p>
<p> | </p>
<p> Dunedin Hospital </p>
<p> | </p>
<p> SDHB </p>
<p> A senior Dunedin       Hospital emergency department specialist says Southern       District Health Board management appear to have backtracked       on recruiting an extra 4.5 senior medical officers for the       department. </p>
<p> However, yesterday board chairman Joe Butterfield said the       extra staffing proposal was still a work in progress, and no       decisions had been made. </p>
<p> In the public-excluded session of its July meeting, the board       approved the ED observation unit business case, which       included $1.779 million extra for ED staffing in the first       year, and $1.695 million in the second year. However, it was       subject to budgetary constraints. </p>
<p> Mr Butterfield was unable to clarify whether those figures       solely related to the possible extra SMOs. </p>
<p> Dr John Chambers, also an Association of Salaried Medical       Specialists union representative, believed the board approved       the additional top staff, but management stopped it,       seemingly because of lack of funds. </p>
<p> Word of the significant extra SMOs was welcomed by senior       staff, who prepared rosters factoring in the additional       resource. </p>
<p> After preparing the rosters the doctors were advised the       extra staff were no longer a top priority. </p>
<p> "It seems to be back to the drawing board. </p>
<p> "My colleagues spent quite a few months developing rosters to       make the best use of the increase in staff to improve our       staffing at the weekends in particular." </p>
<p> There seemed to be a disconnection between the board's       expectations, and what management subsequently decided, he       said. </p>
<p> Dunedin would not have had trouble attracting the       specialists, who had been expected to take up the posts this       year. </p>
<p> "We have capable young specialists who would love to come and       work in Dunedin." </p>
<p> Instead, the department was to get an additional 0.6 SMO, a       position that might not be easy to fill as it was not       full-time. </p>
<p> "Young doctors want a full-time position." </p>
<p> The department had 7.6 SMOs; it should have 12 to 13,       according to professional guidelines, Dr Chambers said. </p>
<p> The recent appointment of two senior registrars was positive,       and they could fill in as senior medical officers, although       only with supervision. However, the pair worked half of their       hours in anaesthetics. </p>
<p> It was disappointing for doctors keenly following       recommendations made by the National Health Board and other       parties for hospital improvements, for which there seemed to       be no money. </p>
<p> It was hoped the specialists would be in place in time for       the new observation ward, which is to open in the middle of       the year. </p>
<p> Chief operating officer (Otago) Vivian Blake said the       proposal approved in the middle of last year had not       specified the extra staff, and was part of a wider business       case for the ED observation unit. </p>
<p> "We haven't got any additional money to put to additional       staffing." </p>
<p> Instead, rosters were being rearranged to make better use of       existing staff. </p>
<p> "At the moment, we have a mismatch of [specialist] rosters to       [patient] attendances." </p>
<p> Doctors at Southland Hospital had also requested an increase       in ED staff, and the DHB was taking a district-wide approach       to the problem. </p>
<p> The Otago and Southland chief medical officers, Richard       Bunton and Dr David Tulloch, were arranging meetings with ED       doctors in both Invercargill and Dunedin. </p>
<p> In an email obtained by the </p>
<p> Otago Daily Times </p>
<p> , Mrs       Blake advised a colleague there was no money "coming our way       via the NHB for this or anything else". </p>
<p> "The first thing to consider is whether this request for       additional FTE is the highest organisational priority ... If       it is agreed that ED is the highest priority, I suggest you       look at whether there is a vacant [senior medical officer] in       the system that can be realigned." </p>
