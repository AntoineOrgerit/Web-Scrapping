<p> Wales could compel restaurants and takeaways to publicly display hygiene ratings on their premises. </p>
<p> Welsh Government ministers are keen to drive up hygiene standards in the principality via a proposed "scores-on-the-doors" system. </p>
<p> Under the scheme, businesses will be rated with a score of between zero and five based on how the food is prepared, cooked, cooled and stored, as well as the condition of the premises. </p>
<p> All food businesses, including supermarkets, would be required to display their score in a prominent position or face fines of up to £1,000. Ratings could also be checked online. </p>
<p> Currently, more than 13,500 businesses have been rated under a voluntary scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), although it is estimated only one in three display their rating. </p>
<p> The new proposals, which would cover around 30,000 businesses in Wales, are due to be published in a draft bill before being ratified. They come following a number of E.coli outbreaks in Wales, which led to calls for a tougher stance. </p>
<p> Health Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "It is already a legal requirement for food businesses to meet hygiene regulations set out in food law, but businesses are not currently required to display their ratings and those with low scores generally do not display them. Compulsory display of hygiene ratings will encourage all businesses to improve their procedures and drive up standards." </p>
<p> A Welsh Government statement also said a mandatory scheme has been backed by Professor Hugh Pennington, who chaired a public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli outbreak in south Wales. It was second biggest E.coli outbreak in the UK and resulted in one death, 31 hospital admissions and long-term health consequences for several children. </p>
<p> Last August, in a separate incident, a kebab house in Cardiff was closed temporarily when a number of people fell ill in an outbreak of E.coli O157. </p>
<p> A Consumer Focus Wales survey in October showed that 94% of people in Wales thought it should be compulsory for food businesses to display their food hygiene rating score. </p>
