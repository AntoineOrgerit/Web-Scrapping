<p> Meet the virgin who fathered 14 children </p>
<p> London,   Tue, 17 Jan 2012 </p>
<p> ANI </p>
<p> London, Jan 17 (ANI): A man in US has the unique distinction of never having had sex but still managing to father 14 children through sperm donation. </p>
<p> Trent Arsenault, 36, hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the US Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a 100,000-dollar fine and up to a year in jail. </p>
<p> Now, the California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene pool to father children, has revealed that he is still a virgin. </p>
<p> He made this confession on Anderson Cooper's daytime show, 'Anderson'. The self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, is in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring. </p>
<p> "I coined this term 'donor sexual' and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that," the Daily Mail quoted him as saying on the show. </p>
<p> "I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin... except I'll have 15 plus kids,' he said. </p>
<p> The audience greeted that statement with applause while Cooper was left laughing in confusion. </p>
<p> Arsenault was visibly moved by meeting one of his offspring for the first time, when Analise, who turns two this week, walked on to the stage at the show. </p>
<p> "I'm trying to not get too emotional," he said. </p>
<p> "I'm just extremely happy that she's healthy and in a loving home. I hope she has the gene of compassion and that her parents nurture that," he said. </p>
<p> Through a website, he touts his sperm as being organic but a health expert on the show warned that his unusual approach to fatherhood opens the door to spreading viral diseases such as HIV. </p>
<p> Her fears echo those of the FDA which claims Arsenault did not take precautions to prevent disease spreading and found him to be unlawfully manufacturing human cells. </p>
<p> The agency issued a 'cease-and-desist order' in what is the first ever case of its kind involving a private sperm donor in the US. </p>
<p> Arsenault said in the past that he is simply helping out childless couples in situations where the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger. </p>
<p> "I'm helping people in need... I'm not running a business here," he was quoted as telling the Huffington Post. (ANI) </p>
