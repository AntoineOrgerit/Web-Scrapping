<p> Mr Right? Men leaving nail clippings out is one of the top turn-offs </p>
<p> Ladies searching for Mr Right, look away now. The ‘perfect man’, it seems, does not exist. </p>
<p> While many chaps have positive attributes, the majority are deeply flawed. </p>
<p> In fact, in a study of 2,000 women, most ranked their partner as only 69 per cent perfect. </p>
<p> Included in a list of 20 common shortfalls are failing to make an effort with their partner’s friends, criticising their driving and the inability to multi-task. </p>
<p> Other male failings include leaving the toilet door open, watching too much sport and poor personal grooming. </p>
<p> Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington, which commissioned the study, said: ‘It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner. </p>
<p> ‘While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won’t get away with.’ </p>
<p> The research found a third of women  will turn a blind eye to their man watching too much sport – as long as  they listen to them when it counts. </p>
<p> But one in five women is convinced  her mischievous partner only pretends to listen to them, while others  believe it’s ‘in one ear and out the other’. </p>
<p> Thankfully, one in five  would forgive leaving the toilet seat up, while the leniency also  stretches to those who don’t help with the cooking. </p>
<p> A quarter of women said dodgy dancing was forgivable, but bugbears such as clothes being left on the bedroom  floor and snoring can count against men. </p>
<p> And guys beware: Leaving the toilet  dirty, not making an effort with their partner’s family and using her  toothbrush are definitely big no-nos. </p>
<p> Leaving out nail clippings, growing a scruffy beard or being too much of a mummy’s boy are other sure fire  ways to guarantee ‘imperfection’. </p>
<p> More... </p>
<p> Female bosses are better! Women more tolerant of staff checking Facebook or doing personal chores in office hours </p>
<p> Working mothers are HAPPIER than stay-at-home mums, study reveals </p>
<p> When asked what would make the perfect man, a good personality came top, followed by a sense of humour and looks. </p>
<p> Miss McReynolds said: ‘The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big  difference.’ </p>
<p> TOP 20 IMPERFECTIONS IN MEN... </p>
<p> 1. Not getting  on with her family </p>
<p> 2. Using her toothbrush </p>
<p> 3. Leaving the toilet dirty </p>
<p> 4. Hating her friends </p>
<p> 5. Not being good with children </p>
<p> 6. Being lazy </p>
<p> 7. Having a big bushy beard that you never shave </p>
<p> 8. Leaves nail clippings out </p>
<p> 9. Driving like a  boy racer </p>
<p> 10. Being grumpy </p>
<p> 11. Being a mummy's boy </p>
<p> 12. Using the  toilet with the door open </p>
<p> 13. Leaving dirty washing on the floor </p>
<p> 14. Unkempt facial hair </p>
<p> 15. Criticising her driving </p>
<p> 16. Burping or farting </p>
<p> 17. Not liking dogs </p>
<p> 18. Not helping with washing  up </p>
<p> 19. Watching too much sport </p>
<p> 20. Not helping with the cooking </p>
