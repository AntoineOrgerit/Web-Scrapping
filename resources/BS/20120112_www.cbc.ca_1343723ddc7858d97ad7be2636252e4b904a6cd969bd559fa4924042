<p> Statistics courtesy: Cancer Care Ontario </p>
<p> The findings of </p>
<p> Cancer in Ottawa 2012 </p>
<p> come from 2007 statistics, the latest available from Cancer Care Ontario, which also show new cancer cases and total cancer deaths in Ottawa have increased since the mid-1980s. The average survival rate has increased, however. </p>
<p> The report also shows the four most common cancers diagnosed in the city — female breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer — are not unlike most other areas. But Ottawa does have a lower rate of both prostate and cervical cancer diagnoses than the rest of Ontario. </p>
<p> For men, the most common cancers were prostate, colorectal, lung and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most deadly of male cancers were lung, colorectal, prostate and pancreatic cancers. </p>
<p> For women, cancer was most prevalent in the breast, lung, colon and body of the uterus. The most deadly were lung, breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. </p>
<p> Overall, survival rates have increased in the city between five-year periods of 1993-1997 and 2003-2007. </p>
<p> The data is about five years old so the report warns the information "may not be a truly representative picture of the current burden of cancer in Ottawa." </p>
<p> You can read the </p>
<p> full report here </p>
<p> , which will be presented to the Ottawa Board of Health on Jan. 16. </p>
