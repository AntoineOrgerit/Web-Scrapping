<p> Paula Deen </p>
<p> 's ready to talk, y'all. </p>
<p> The celebrity chef plans to set the record straight regarding dogged rumors that she has type 2 diabetes in a </p>
<p> TODAY Show </p>
<p> interview with </p>
<p> Al Roker </p>
<p> next Tuesday.  The Southern-accented Food Network star and cookbook author, 64, became a household name for her decadent comfort food recipes heavy on fried food, butter and other fatty ingredients. </p>
<p> PHOTOS: Celeb health scares </p>
<p> An April 2010 </p>
<p> National Enquirer </p>
<p> story first alleging the diagnosis resurfaced on Friday, when </p>
<p> The Daily </p>
<p> reported that Deen plans to confirm the news -- and that she's signed on to be the spokeswoman for a Novartis drug that treats the disease. </p>
<p> PHOTOS: Most talked-about celeb bods of the year </p>
<p> (A Novartis rep told </p>
<p> CBSNews </p>
<p> that talk of an endorsement deal was false.) </p>
<p> The author of five cookbooks has been slammed by the likes of fellow TV food personality </p>
<p> Anthony Bourdain </p>
<p> (he called her "the worst, most dangerous person to America" for her unhealthy recipes) and </p>
<p> Barbara Walters, </p>
<p> who accused her in 2009 of encouraging childhood obesity. </p>

<p> This is wonderful time for Paula to be an advocate for diabetes.  She could teach people with diabetes how to prepare a diabetic diet regimen and make it taste good. </p>

<p> As a Type II diabetic I have to ask you,Erlinda, are you kidding me?  Eating BUTTER, SALT, and FAT does NOT lead to diabetes!  In fact, butter and other fats are foods that diabetics can safely eat, along with other low carb foods.  Apparently you know zilch, zero, zippo about diabetes and how people get it, so please stop saying ignorant things! </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 11:53pm </p>
<p> Cindy Peck Pereira </p>
<p> @Erlinda, "Real Chef's" especially French Chefs use and abundance of, Butter, Cream and salt as flavor enhancers.  The point most are making, and even Paula herself says know one should eat the meals she showcases everyday. And what does Anthony Bourdain know about health? He's always drinking and complaining of of a hangover! Stop hating people. </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 11:43pm </p>

<p> Leave Paula Deen alone.  If you don't like the way she cooks, don't cook her food.  If you don't like her, don't watch her, but slamming a person for something you don't like is just absurd, she's not forcing you to eat her food so back off.  She is a fabulous person and doesn't deserve this.  I am an overweight person and happen to love watching Paula Deen and if I like a receipe she makes, I just try to adjust it to make it more healthy.  You keep up the great work Paula and don't listen to all the negative remarks.  When these people are perfect then they can talk until that time, they should keep their mouths shut. </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 10:01pm </p>
<p> Jay Donovan </p>
<p> Paula is a typical old style southern cook.  What she makes is delicious but its dangerous if one tends to overeat.  If one chooses not to follow the way of the sloth, the food is perfectly good.  As for Anthony Bourdain--too high brow for me  and his show is 20 miles south of boring.  Barbara Walters should just stick to clam chowder and Boston baked beans.  Perhaps her obesity comment would be best used on people who are not teaching children self control--their parents.  It's easy to stuff a child with bad food and equally bad habits in order to keep them quiet then to take the initiative and teach them self control. </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 8:06pm </p>
<p> Eileen Droge </p>
<p> Let me just say I love Paula Deen.  Let me also say that there is not one healthy show on the food channel. People love food it's  the center of our being.  Everything surrounds it.  I know people who eat healthy and still have diseases.  Sickness comes from the enviroment it's all around us.  We will never be a healthy society.  Thats what keeps doctors and drug compines in business.  Think about it, and leave paula deen alone . </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 12:22pm </p>
<p> Sandra JO Wallace </p>
<p> I love Paula Dean. I have been watching her show for a long time now.Some day I hope to meet her. She is the best person on the Food network. </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 12:07pm </p>
<p> Elizabeth Aspen </p>
<p> As someone with Type 2 myself, I have always been angry and horrified by what she pushes on kids and calls "food". This woman shouldn't be allowed to endorse anything. </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 11:54am </p>
<p> Clair Isbell </p>
<p> Ok, everyone who wants to complain about how horrible Paula Deen's food is for people, tell me something, has she ever forced you into eatting the food she makes?? I didnt think so! It's not like she made herself famous, she is famous because oviously people like her food!! She has never hidden the fact that some recipes aren't healthy for you. Also she makes southern food, which by nature, is not healthy!!  So if you don't like her, dont read </p>
<p> January 14, 2012 - 10:44am </p>
<p> April Slinkard </p>
<p> Who cares, plenty of people in the south eat fatty, fried foods. She is just appealing to her audience. Its not like anyone HAS to cook her recipes, people chose to. She is not responsible for ANYTHING. </p>

<p> all of you posting that Paula having D2 is no big deal are seriously ignorant. As a "chef", with a VERY public personal life and numerous cookbooks and shows, WHY would you want to make any of her food? So you can get D2 as well? Butter is NOT natural. Look it up, educate yourself. Paula is over-weight and obviously unhealthy person. All I know is that I wouldn't make any of her food. All of you who are supporting a tv cook for living an unhealthy lifestyle is just an example of how ignorant & uneducated this country is about the food supply. </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 11:11pm </p>
<p> Michelle Haigood </p>
<p> I cook for a diabetic and kids, once in a while it's nice to make something without restrictions but if you are going to blame other people for your own choices, you're not even a sheep, you're a lemming. </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 10:56pm </p>
<p> Eric Walker </p>
<p> @Linda Pravettone Botulism is also natural...it doesn't make it good... </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 9:48pm </p>
<p> Evelyn Arnold </p>
<p> OK first why is Paula's health a concern to anyone but her and her family? Fans or in this case non fan's feel just because someone is a celebrity it gives them the right to delve into thier personal space or lives. They are only people, yes they walk,talk,live,go through things just as you and I. So if she is diabetic.So if she isnt. This is a grown woman that came from extreme hard times and made something of herself for her children. Can you say SURVIVAL? This is what this woman did. SHe made a way for her family to survive. I bet she didnt ask any one person reading this for a thing. If you dont like her turn your TV to another channel. She isnt sitting there forcing you to watch. As for her not being a chef because she didnt spend the big money others complaining did. I applaud her even more. Look what she did from teaching herself on what she had. I say stop hateing! You may have someone looking at you and your life tomorrow! </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 9:38pm </p>
<p> Linda Pravettone </p>
<p> Let's post comments for Paula Deen, not just those against. Butter is bad is it? Don't think so. How about talking about all the chemicals, pesticides, and preservatives that we ingest on a daily basis? Why don't we talk about the artificial sweeteners laced with cancer causing chemicals? Why don't we have a common sense conversation about how unhealthy our food is and not bash Paula because she uses butter, a natural ingredient in many foods. </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 9:24pm </p>
<p> Linda Pravettone </p>
<p> Oh please people. Those of you who say she is not a chef need to get a life. Have you seen the garbage that those "chefs" put out? My dog wouldn't eat it. Paula cooks meals that the everyday person would eat and enjoy. As for her recipes being blamed for an unhealthy lifestyle, get real. I want those same people to start complaining about all the chemicals, preservatives, and pesticides, that we are ingesting on a daily basis for the sake of shelf life, and profit. Butter never hurt anyone but all those chemicals you can't name, does. </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 9:14pm </p>
<p> Linda Taylor </p>
<p> Well, Lynn,  the last I knew we all were able to make choices on our own which result in consequences.  Why should Paula Deen be responsible for for the public's "ticking health time-bomb"?  I find her quite entertaining and have never made one of her recipes.  I find it refreshing that she has earned every bit of her "big, fat piggy bank" herself and has not had it handed to her on a silver platter.  She must be a good business woman and not a "spoon-licken" fraudster. </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 9:12pm </p>
<p> Pat Bunny Levy </p>
<p> Sorry to hear Paula has a serious health issue. However, I am not supprised and no it is not her cooking! It is all the damn chemicals in food these days. The drug companies love it cause hey get to sell more of their drugs at top dollar. I think if anything she will be an open and honest spokeperson for Type II Diabetes. Paula if yo cut back on the carbs and exercise you will find you will be able to get off the meds. Sending love, prayers and support Pat Levy </p>
<p> January 13, 2012 - 9:09pm </p>
<p> N Americans Vanline </p>
<p> She's just a housewife who cooks out of necessity. She's NOT A CHEF and please do not refer her as a chef.    "TV food personality Anthony Bourdain (he called her "the worst, most dangerous person to America" for her unhealthy recipes) and Barbara Walters, who accused her in 2009 of encouraging childhood obesity"   Enough said </p>
