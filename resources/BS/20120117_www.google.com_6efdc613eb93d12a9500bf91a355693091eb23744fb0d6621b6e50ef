<p> Further doubt has been cast on a study suggesting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of breast cancer. </p>
<p> A link between HRT and the disease has proved controversial, with several studies suggesting the finding has been blown out of proportion. </p>
<p> However, other research has reinforced the link or shown a drop in breast cancer rates alongside declining HRT use. </p>
<p> Writing in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care, experts said the Million Women Study in the UK - which has reiterated the link several times - does not in fact establish HRT as a cause of breast cancer. </p>
<p> However, they did not rule out that HRT may increase risk of the disease. </p>
<p> First published in 2003 and funded by Cancer Research UK, the Million Women Study found that using combined HRT doubles a woman's risk of developing breast cancer compared with women not taking HRT. </p>
<p> An update in August last year found similar results after a longer follow-up, including a "rapid fall in risk after HRT is stopped". </p>
<p> But experts from South Africa, Germany and the UK analysed the study and said: "HRT may or may not increase the risk of breast cancer, but the Million Women Study did not establish that it does." </p>
<p> The authors examined criteria applied to scientific research to show a causal link, such as biases and biological implausibility, to review the findings of the study. </p>
<p> Their analysis highlighted several design flaws that they say would have skewed the findings. For example, cancers detected within a few months of the study's start would have already been present when the women were enrolled in the research, but these were not excluded, they said. </p>
