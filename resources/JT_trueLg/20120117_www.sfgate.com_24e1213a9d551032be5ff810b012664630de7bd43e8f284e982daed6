<p>A recent study from the Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation (DOCS) shows that 30% of Americans avoid the dentist because of fear or anxiety. Dr. Jerry Strauss, a dentist in New Jersey, says he not only uses sedation dentistry to alleviate patient fears, but also create positive dental experiences. He adds that patients need to discuss all available options with their dentist, and develop a plan that meets their needs and expectations when considering sedation dentistry.</p>
<p>Fairfield, NJ (PRWEB) January 17, 2012</p>
<p>The Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation (DOCS) recently conducted a study that found 30% of Americans avoid dental visits because of fear or anxiety. Dr. Jerry Strauss provides a wide range of dental treatments, including general, sedation, and cosmetic dentistry in New Jersey. He says sedation dentistry allows his patients to relax, which in turn helps create positive dental experiences and safe, effective results. When choosing a sedation dentistry practice, Dr. Strauss recommends discussing all available options for sedation, as well as the dentist's experience with each procedure.</p>
<p>Also commonly referred to as sleep dentistry, Dr. Strauss says the name can be misleading as the patient actually remains conscious throughout the entire procedure. The purpose of sedation dentistry according to Dr. Strauss is simply to put the patient in a state of relaxation to ensure they are not consumed by the fear they typically experience during dental treatment.</p>
<p>While intravenous sedation is the traditional method used for sedation dentistry, Dr. Strauss says less invasive methods are gaining in popularity, including inhalation sedation and oral sedation. Regardless of the method employed, Dr. Strauss says the dental procedure does not necessarily determine the type of sedation method. Instead, he stresses the need to address each individual treatment plan along with the specifics of a patient's case before deciding on the type of sedation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dr. Strauss says patients appreciate the sedation dentistry option at his practice because they do not have to feel the pain or experience anxiety associated with any number of the procedures he offers. However, Dr. Strauss says the main benefit of alleviating these concerns for his patients is the fact that it allows him and his staff to maintain the oral health of his patients. "Fortunately, sedation techniques allow us to comfortably treat the true dental phobics, those people that have had bad experiences and have anxiety about dental treatment and even the medically compromised. I believe dental sedation is one of the real critical components to success in dentistry."</p>
<p>About Jerry Strauss, DMD</p>

Upon graduation, he received the Academy of General Dentistry Award from the faculty at Boston University. Dr. Strauss is also a graduate of the Las Vegas Institute for Advanced Dental Studies. He has achieved Mastership Status in the Academy of General Dentistry, which is the highest honor the organization bestows upon its members.
