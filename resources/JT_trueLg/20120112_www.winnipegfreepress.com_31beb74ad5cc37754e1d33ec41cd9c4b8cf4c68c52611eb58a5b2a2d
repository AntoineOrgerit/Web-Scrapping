<p>Saskatoon hospitals see surge in patients, every room and overflow area filled</p>

<p>SASKATOON - A busy time at Saskatoon's three hospitals is causing a bed shortage for patients needing acute care.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region says the overload of patients isn't due to any one reason.</p>
<p>Deb Gudmundson, the region's executive director of acute care, says the three-week surge has mostly affected St. Paul's and Royal University hospitals.</p>
<p>She says they have created overflow areas with four or five beds, but when those are full, some patients have been treated in the hallway until a bed is available.</p>
<p>The health region says admissions to Royal University Hospital were 503 in December, compared to 413 last year.</p>
<p>It also says the average stay at St. Paul's has gone up almost 10 per cent over last year.</p>
<p>Gudmundson says if things stay this busy, the health region will have to make some decisions.</p>
