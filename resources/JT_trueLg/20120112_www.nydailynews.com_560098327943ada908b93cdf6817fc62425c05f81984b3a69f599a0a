<p>Illegal bushmeat smuggled into the city has the potential to spread harmful diseases according to a new study released this week.</p>

<p>A study of bushmeat smuggled into the city shows it could spread disease or even spark pandemics, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Denise McAloose, chief pathologist for the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, said no one had tested illegal bushmeat for pathogens before the study.</p>
<p>Animal parts seized by custom agents at Kennedy Airport were routinely destroyed until the WCS partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008 for the research.</p>
<p>"We wanted to know if in those confiscated materials there might be anything of significance, so we started looking," McAloose told the News.</p>
<p>In 2010, the pilot program expanded to airports servicing Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta and Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Scientists found simian foamy viruses and two types of herpesviruses in the animal parts tested.</p>
<p>While the herpesviruses detected are not considered dangerous to people, related viruses cause disease in humans.</p>
<p>Researchers say the results show potential danger.</p>
<p>“Diseases such as HIV, Ebola, swine flu, avian flu and monkey pox all originated in wildlife," McAloose said. "We don't know where the next disease like that might occur."</p>
<p>Some animal skulls, hands, arms and torsos were still fresh in coolers when confiscated. Others were long dead and dried out.</p>
<p>Tissue from the freshest part each animal, including raw or red muscle, joint fluid or bone marrow, was preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C.</p>
<p>Scientists from WCS and the American Museum of Natural History used advanced genetic barcoding technology to identify each animal species.</p>
<p>The 25 primates tested included baboons, mangabeys, guenons, green monkeys and endangered chimpanzees. They also identified 35 rats.</p>
<p>The study is ongoing, and straw bats that were recently seized at JFK will be analyzed during the next phase.</p>
<p>Tissues were tested for pathogens at CDC and Columbia University labs.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from contact with wildlife, and researchers fear the wildlife trade could spur new pandemics.</p>
<p>"Every point along the trade route, from the hunter to the seller to the shipper, has the potential to be exposed to whatever that animal was carrying," said McAloose.</p>
<p>Researchers are calling for more education about the dangers of wildlife trading and harsher penalties for illegal activity.</p>
