<p>London hospitals in 'shocking state' says MPs' report</p>

<p>NHS London needs 'urgent change'</p>
<p>Q&A: The NHS shake-up</p>
<p>Patient deaths 'due to staffing'</p>
<p>London's health chiefs have been warned some patients will "die earlier" because of the deteriorating standard of some hospitals in the capital.</p>
<p>The Public Accounts Committee report said some London hospitals were in a "particularly shocking state".</p>
<p>The Whitehall spending watchdog added many NHS trusts in outer London were facing money and management problems and could be forced to close or merge.</p>
<p>NHS London said funding would be made available to improve patient care.</p>
<p>Chair Margaret Hodge MP said the committee was alarmed that the healthcare system in London had been "allowed to deteriorate despite its problems having been known about for many years".</p>
<p>She said at least half of the acute trusts were not viable.</p>
<p>The Labour MP for Barking said: "The hospitals which will probably survive are in the centre of London and the people who live on the outskirts will have to get a bus and that takes time, it costs money.</p>
<p>"Many people will choose not to do so and they will simply get ill and die earlier and that is unacceptable."</p>
<p>'Remain to be convinced'</p>
<p>The government had wanted all NHS trusts to achieve foundation trust status by 2014, but this deadline has now been scrapped.</p>
<p>Foundation status gives trusts more freedom on how much they spend and borrow, but requires them to get their finances in order.</p>
<p>Of the 20 hospital trusts across England that have declared they will never make foundation status, half are in London.</p>
<p>Mrs Hodge said despite being assured by the Department of Health there were no plans to close hospitals, some trusts were in such a poor financial state that it was difficult to see why other organisations would want to take them on.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a report by the King's Fund warned that NHS London needed "urgent change".</p>
<p>Mrs Hodge added: "We remain to be convinced that combining struggling hospitals into larger trusts - as with south London - will somehow produce viable organisations offering good quality, accessible healthcare."</p>
<p>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he was prepared to tackle the issue and that independent assessments would be carried out on trusts to identify what was going wrong.</p>
<p>NHS London said it knew some hospitals might need to change or merge with others to meet foundation trust standards.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said while "patient care was good in some places, it was not good enough everywhere".</p>
<p>"We can improve care by bringing services, such as minor surgery, X-rays and blood tests, out of hospitals and closer to where people live," said the spokesperson, adding that funding would be made available to achieve this.</p>
