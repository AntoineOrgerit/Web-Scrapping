<p>An appetite-suppressing hormone produced by the body that is used to treat type 2 diabetes can lead to weight loss in overweight or obese patients, says a new study.</p>
<p>The research, published Tuesday at bmj.com, also found that glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, reduces blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>GLP-1 is a hormone secreted by the gut when we eat.</p>
<p>A form of GLP-1 that is injected has emerged as a new treatment for type 2 diabetes for its ability to regulate blood-sugar levels.</p>
<p>But researchers have now found that the hormone can help with weight loss by curbing the appetite, thereby reducing food intake.</p>
<p>The Danish study, which included data from 6,000 patients who took part in 25 randomized controlled trials, found that in addition to lowering blood pressure and cholesterol -- as well as regulating blood sugar -- GSP-1 also helped with weight loss. Study subjects lost up to eight pounds over a four-month period.</p>
<p>While both patients with and without type 2 diabetes lost weight, the weight loss was more pronounced in patients without the disease.</p>
<p>"We see a sustained effect on body weight throughout the trials, 25 trials," researcher Dr. Tina Vilsboll, head of diabetes research at the University of Copenhagen, told CTV News. "So it is not just a coincidence, it is efficacious on body weight."</p>
<p>The findings are especially significant because other diabetes medications often cause patients to gain, rather than lose, weight.</p>
<p>The researchers write that further study is needed to determine if GLP-1, which costs about $400 per month, should be prescribed for overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>According to Vilsboll, researchers will know within the next two to three years if GLP-1 can be more widely prescribed solely as weight-loss treatment.</p>
<p>The study has led some experts to urge caution, however.</p>
<p>In an accompanying editorial, obesity specialist Dr. Raj Padwal of the University of Alberta points out that the weight loss was modest.</p>
<p>As well, the hormone can produce side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and comes with a possible risk of damage to the pancreas and the thyroid.</p>
<p>"While these results highlight the weight-reducing benefits, they should not alter current practice," Padwal wrote.</p>
<p>According to Padwal, "modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes."</p>
<p>Vilsboll said the hormone is not a cure for type 2 diabetes. However, combined with lifestyle changes, it could have a major impact on the health of patients.</p>
<p>Dr. Ravi Retnakaran of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital is also studying the hormone, and says the research "is an encouraging sign because weight control is an important part of the management of diabetes."</p>
