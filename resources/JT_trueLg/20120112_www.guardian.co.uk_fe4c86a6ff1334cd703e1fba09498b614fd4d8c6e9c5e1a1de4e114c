<p>McDonald's to give away 9m Michael Morpurgo books with kids' meals</p>

<p>From the red carpet to the golden arches: an unlikely champion in the battle to get children reading has emerged in the shape of McDonald's, which is set to give away nine million books by Michael Morpurgo, author of the smash hit children's novel War Horse, with its Happy Meals.</p>
<p>The fast food chain has linked up with publisher HarperCollins to hand out millions of copies of former children's laureate Morpurgo's Mudpuddle Farm books, aimed at younger readers, along with its Happy Meals, in one of its biggest ever promotions.</p>
<p>The move is supported by the National Literacy Trust, which said that McDonald's "size and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read together". Eight out of 10 families visit McDonald's, according to the fast food chain. Pointing to the National Literacy Trust's recent research which showed that one in three children in the UK – almost four million – don't own a book, director Jonathan Douglas said he was "very supportive of McDonald's decision to give families access to popular books".</p>
<p>Titles offered to Happy Meal purchasers between 11 January and 7 February will include Morpurgo's Mossop's Last Chance and Martians at Mudpuddle Farm, with each book coming with a finger puppet. The novels, about the animals who live in the farmyard on Mudpuddle farm, will also be on sale at McDonald's restaurants without the need to buy a Happy Meal, it said.</p>
<p>Booktrust, the government-backed charity which gives away five million books a year to babies and children, also supported the McDonald's scheme, despite the recent furore in California over the company's inclusion of free toys with their Happy Meals. Happy Meals were banned in Santa Clara County in 2010; the county supervisor behind the ban said at the time that its intention was to "prevent restaurants from preying on children's love of toys to peddle high calorie, high fat, high sodium kids' meals. It breaks the link between unhealthy food and prizes."</p>
<p>Booktrust director Viv Bird was very positive about the partnership, however. "There is a real cultural challenge around reading for pleasure and we've got to be really careful, particularly in the current climate and with the concerns about literacy standards, that parents don't think reading is only about phonics – that they realise enjoying reading is just as important. This partnership with McDonald's Happy Meals and HarperCollins sends a really powerful message that reading is for everyone," she said. "You've got Michael Morpurgo, the ex children's laureate whose writing is fantastic, you've got quality books which are going to reach lots of families who wouldn't necessarily go into libraries or bookshops: what is there to disagree with?"</p>
<p>Jack Sallabank, brand partnership manager at the National Literacy Trust, said, meanwhile, that "the National Literacy Trust's interest in the McDonald's campaign is not related to the number of Happy Meals sold. Nine million books will be distributed to children during the campaign. In a society where one in three children don't own a book, this type of campaign will be hugely effective at reaching those who aren't introduced to reading at home and done so in an environment in which they feel comfortable."</p>

<p>Stunningly bad. No. This should not be happening.</p>
<p>Not because I per se disapprove of the existence of fast food, or the advertising of books, but the combination of associating reading with fast food and then using it as incentive for children to eat fast food is something that's shockingly bad.</p>
<p>Especially for an author like Morpugo, who should be able to sell books on their own merits.</p>

<p>I want to think positively about this - kids are going to McDonald's in ridiculous numbers anyway, so at least they might get a book out of it, and one by a fine and respected children's author. But I'd like to know if these books will be reprinted with a McDonald's logo, or a foreword by Ronald. If so, they can McF*ck off. How ironic that one of the books is about animals who live on a farm. If it was about freakish steroidal chickens with their beaks burned off, living in a factory up to their knees in shit, I'd give my blessing to this promotion in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>I sense Guardian readers spontanously combusting at the Morpurgo-McDonalds mash up!!</p>
<p>It's good, but it's bad, but it's good!!! Yes but No but Yes but No!!!</p>
<p>If only one child reads this with their Happy Meal and then moves on to the rest of Mr Morpurgo's books then it will be a good thing!!!</p>
<p>As the father of a nine year old who started on Mudpuddle and has been steadily working her way through the entire published works of Micheal Morpurgo for the last three years I am unreservedly pleased about this.</p>
<p>It's ten times better than the plastic toys - althoug t kids may disagree!!</p>
<p>note to sub-editor - it's Mudpuddle Farm not Molpuddle Farm.</p>

<p>R042 - little tip. When angry about something, vent it, maybe on an email or in a comments section, walk away, have a nice cup of tea then come back and read and then change what you've written.</p>
<p>This clearly isn't an incentive for children to eat more fast food or even associating fast food with books.</p>
<p>One way of looking at it is for children who are eating at McDonalds, rather than getting another Disney toy they get a book. That's a good thing.</p>
<p>If any parent is taking their kids to McDonalds purely on the basis of getting a free book they're probably going to use it to stop their table sloping.</p>

<p>Yes! It's great!MacDonalds gets to give more kids morbid obesity, books are forever associated with crap food and calorific incontinence, and MacD's gets to feed their little minds too, with the idea that animal farms are cute little buccolic romper rooms, whilst , back in the real world,relentlessly forcing the spread of industrial- scale meat factories, with, as Dan North puts it, steroidal chickens living knee-deep in their own shit.</p>
<p>What is there in this cynical marketing ploy not to be unreservedly pleased about? It's a win-win for multinational corporations making billions from making kids ill while destroying the environment, and witless, lazy middle-class parents. Hurrah!</p>
<p>As for Morpurgo, when will people stop writing this deluding Flibble-flobble Farm crap? Imagine if he applied the same idiotic trops to the first world war- Look! Muffin the warhorse trotting round the Somme, such fun, fighting, he says! Look at the German horses, laughing and playing in the sun! Can we come next year, oh please!</p>

<p>No. Good old macD really are doing this for pure altruistic reasons. At no point did it even cross the mind of anyone in their marketing department to sell more MacNuggets. How mean of anyone to even think it. As for associating books with fast food, how indeed could giving books away with fast food conceivably have that effect?</p>
<p>Thank you for your incisive thoughts.</p>

<p>Some inane knee-jerk comments here.</p>
<p>There are four million UK kids who don't even have a book of their own.</p>
<p>I'd be willing to bet that the overlap with kids who feed in McDonalds is pretty high.</p>
<p>So that means that some kids will get some books.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid, some of them might even.... ENJOY them!!!!</p>

<p>This will not sell more Happy Meals; if anything it'll sell fewer because kids won't be trying to 'collect the set' of the usual Disney tie-in tat. To that extent I think it's a bit curmudgeonly to get bothered by it - it seems win-win to me. MacDonalds get some positive marketing, and some kids who might otherwise not have any books at home get an opportunity to read something decent.</p>
<p>But - one in three children with no books at home? That sounds incredibly high to me - even parents that don't read themselves usually have at least one or two baby books, don't they? I suspect the statistics are being skewed in some way; perhaps the definition of 'children' is being taken to mean over-fives or something like that.</p>

<p>Kids will be going to McDonalds whatever posters here think. The good news is those not likely to own books are more likely to be visiting McDonalds so will get these books ... my kids won't be going there, but then they own several hundred books a piece plus hundreds more ebooks (hey the classics are FREE) so do not need another book and being snobby middle class kids prefer the handmade burger company on occassions when i take them out for such a meal (my bank balance on the other hand loves mcdonalds, and i love Big Macs!) though they now prefer going for an indian.</p>

<p>Yes - I just looked at the report and it's based on an online survey of 8-17-year-olds. The 4-million figure, however, would represent (slightly more than) one third of all children in the UK (according to Wolfram|Alpha, that's 10.4 million). I don't think that's likely to be accurate because I'd imagine under-fives are much more likely to have books.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, of course - even half that number would still be an enormous amount! But it did jump out at me somewhat.</p>

<p>The invective here seems sorely misplaced.</p>
<p>We all agree that having more children reading is a good thing. This will get more books into more hands. If we want to get books into the hands of kids who would never have got them otherwise then we have to try new things.</p>

<p>Good God - I read this and came down with chronic Eco Fatigue - I used to work with foster kids and one of the best places to get anything out of them was in McDonald's over a Happy Meal - oh, and NONE of the kids I worked with were morbidly obese. There's a lot of shite talked about McDonald's who are no better or worse than Birds Eye,Tesco or Costco. Ironically, the kids getting the free books will mostly be middle class Mumsy's having their Birthday Party with their friends after school. Now, I'm off for a Big Mac with bacon and fries - but don't worry, I never go LARGE.</p>

<p>Strewth, i cant believe some of the comments on here!</p>
<p>Surely anything that puts a book into the hands of a child has got to be a good thing hasnt it?</p>
<p>Plus lets get this right McDonalds ( or any other fast food outlet) is not responsible for a proliferation of fat kids. Will people stop allowing PARENTS the opportunity to abdicate any responsibility for what goes in their kids mouth.</p>
<p>Kids are fat because parents allow them to eat too much and not do enough exercise, its as simple as that. That aint McDs fault.</p>
<p>I think flatfrog has a point as well, i dont think giving away a book will boost sales of Happy Meals. My kids have never been bothered about the tripe that comes with a Happy Meal and unless its an exclusive, unavailable elsewhere book then theyre not going to be particularly bothered about this.</p>
<p>But let me stress, its not fast food outlets that are responsible for fatties! What is wrong with this country these days? Too many pass the buck without taking any responsibility for how they live their lives!</p>

<p>Not so sure about B).The McD brand may be toxic to (some of) his habitual readers parents but that doesn't make (say) "Waiting For Anya" a bad book - his curent buyers will continue to buy.He may open up a whole new market for his books amongst the "fat and stupid" that (according to cif) are the only people who ever go into McDonalds.</p>

<p>Puts a new meaning on the idea of Readers Digest.Anyway it will backfire as likely to put some kids off reading altogether.</p>

<p>The more kids that have books and get into reading the better as it's a key skill in order to discover and understand the world. The more that kids discover and understand the world the less likely they'll be to eat McDonald's. Brilliant.</p>

<p>Good idea.</p>
<p>They should also have free Big Macs with book sales in WH Smith.</p>
<p>And free anti-depressants with Dan Brown novels...</p>

<p>How so? Why would getting a free book put off you off reading when you might have adopted it otherwise?</p>

<p>McD don't lassoe children in the street and drag them in you know - parents are responsible for what their children eat.</p>
<p>True, I suppose, but...</p>
<p>Look, I'm pro-free market, and like nothing better than to mock nanny-state numpties from the left, but on this topic, I'm forced to concede they have a point.</p>
<p>McDonalds consistently and deliberately market their vile trash at children - they are utterly devoid of any corporate responsibility or ethics.</p>
<p>We do not allow alcohol or tobacco companies to market to kids (despite the fact that kids would not be able to afford to buy their product), I don't think there is a material difference in this case...indeed, a glass of red wine per day is much healthier for an adult than a Big Mac.</p>
<p>How I detest this company. Everything about them is utterly contemptible.</p>

<p>Martian landed in our high street. Asked what the empty building was. That used to be a library, said someone. What's a library? says the Martian. It's a place where you could go in and get books for free, says the person. And what's that? says the Martian. That's Macdonald's. said the person. What's Macdonald's, says the Martian. It's a place where you can go in and buy hamburgers and stuff, says the person. But, there are people there getting books for free, says the Martian, you must be wrong about it being this Macdonald's thing, it must be a library.</p>

<p>One in three children don't own a book.</p>
<p>They aren't going to go to McDonald's to get a book, they're going to go anyway.</p>
<p>Michael Morpurgo can selll his books without this, but what Michael Morpurgo can't do is sell his, or anybody else's, books to the one in three children who don't own a book.</p>
<p>One in three children don't own a book, people!</p>
<p>One in every three children in this country do not have a book to call their own. That's appalling and should be stopped. The only way to stop it is by giving them books, and not in a way where they, or their parents, have to modify their behaviour to get the books, but to take the books to where they are anyway and give them the books there.</p>
<p>One in three children!</p>

<p>I don't blieve that statistic.Not in the sesne "isn't it awful!" - in the literal sense that I do not believe it to be true.(I also don't believe the one in three kids are obese statistic - becasue BMI says I am obe4se, and although I could stand losing half a stone I am not obese!)</p>

<p>I don't think for a second that they don't see a greasy dollar sign slapped on each book (companies try to make as much money - ohh the shock horror) My point was clearly if a kid has a book rather than a toy, that's good right?</p>
<p>And thanks for the snipey comment. Definitely necessary.</p>

<p>The point about Morgurgo's inane books is not so much the realism, or otherwise, of their tedious Mufty Mofty Fluffy Farm stuff, but the fact of MacDonald's using them as a cynical propaganda tool to continue the general complacency (shared by pretty much all the comments on this site) about the reality of where the muck that families stuff into their kid's faces actually comes from, and who and what suffers for it.I personally love tales of cute, cuddly speculative bankers and their generous presents to all the unwashed trolls, but I wouldn't be so keen if they were given to my offspring by Barclay's.</p>
<p>And can anyone explain why parents shoulder not just some, but all of the blame for the rubbish their children eat, when MacD spend billions each year devising ever more ruthless ways (including this one) of persuading these kids to embark on a lifetime of steroidal nugget munching?I try to prevent my kids smoking, but I think I would be justifyably miffed if Phillip Morris targeted their marketing directly at them. You would no doubt think that was part of the cut and thrust of marketing, and if the little scamps developed a 60 a day habit by the age of seven, the fag companies had nothing whatsoever to do with it.</p>
