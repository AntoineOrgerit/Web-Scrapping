<p>A sign at Bubby's in Osaka, Japan describes just how fresh the lemonade is.</p>
<p>'Fresh, as in f**king fresh!'</p>

<p>One culture's swear word is another one's favourite adjective. It seems Japan has adopted one of the West's nasty four-lettered words with great gusto, using it to describe anything that's really fantastic.</p>
<p>A New Yorker says he is to blame for this recent phenomenon. Owner and chef for a restaurant chain called Bubby's, Ron Silver was in Yokohama, Japan in 2009 setting up a branch of the restaurant there when he insisted on fresh produce. According to Silver, the Japanese use a lot of frozen goods and in his frustration to explain fresh to his staff, he ranted at them, "I mean f**king fresh, man."</p>
<p>The following day, his staff asked him whether by fresh he meant canned, which started him ranting again, " What do you not understand about f**ing fresh?"</p>
<p>According to the original report on Gawker.com, Silver's staff may have been teasing him the whole time as they soon decorated the Bubby's logo with the slogan, "f***kin fresh".</p>
<p>So catchy is it, that it's become the unofficial slogan of the Osaka branch, written on the menus and adverts, like "F**kin Fresh & Delicious food" and "Bubby's F**kin Fresh lemonade" — dropping the "g" seems a popular spelling of the word.</p>
<p>Now, it seems, the new-found adjective has been adopted elsewhere, with signs advertising a "f**kin sale" in Osaka, Japan, recently reported by Gawker.com.</p>
<p>Whether or not the phrase originated at Bubby's, one thing is for certain, the Japanese have a certain way with the English language.</p>
