<p>BC Coroners Service Information Bulletin</p>
<p>CTVNews.ca Staff</p>
<p>Date: Tuesday Jan. 17, 2012 10:26 AM ET</p>
<p>The British Columbia Coroners Service is investigating whether highly toxic ecstasy that's been linked to a number of deaths in Western Canada claimed the life of a teenage boy in Langley, B.C. over the weekend.</p>
<p>The unidentified boy was out with friends on Sunday when he reportedly took ecstasy, along with other drugs. He collapsed and his friends called 911. Though he was rushed to Langley Memorial Hospital, he could not be revived.</p>
<p>The death comes after a week of B.C. and Alberta health officials warned that some of the ecstasy that's circulating in the West appears to be contaminated with a synthetic chemical called PMMA, or paramethoxy-methamphetamine.</p>
<p>The chemical has been linked to five recent drug deaths in Calgary and at least five deaths in B.C. over the last six months.</p>
<p>The B.C. Coroners Service has asked for toxicology tests to be carried out as soon as possible on the boy who died over the weekend.</p>
<p>The tests will determine whether the boy took ecstasy and, if so, whether the pills contained PMMA. Results may be available within days.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether PMMA is being introduced intentionally or by accident during the ecstasy manufacturing process.</p>
<p>B.C.'s chief coroner, Lisa Lapointe, told reporters last week that PMMA is something her office hasn't seen before in relation to ecstasy deaths. But she added that the coroners service did not begin testing for PMMA until it was linked to the five deaths in Calgary.</p>
<p>PMMA is a dangerous chemical that can cause the body to heat up to the point of severe brain and organ damage or death. The chemical appears to make the ecstasy take longer to take effect. That can prompt some people to take more pills, resulting in an overdose.</p>
<p>B.C. recently reviewed toxicology findings for 12 ecstasy-related deaths in 2011 and two deaths this year. PMMA was detected in five cases.</p>
<p>In most of the five cases, users had taken other drugs, as well as alcohol. But in one of the five deaths, the individual took only one tablet, prompting Lapointe to point out: "There is no known safe dose."</p>
<p>The coroners service emphasized it has no idea how much ecstasy currently in circulation contains the chemical.</p>
<p>The Canadian Press reports that police in B.C. have noted unique markings on ecstasy pills suspected to contain the lethal additive, but are reluctant to reveal the markings to the public because they don't want users thinking other ecstasy pills are safe.</p>

<p>They know which pills are affected so do the responsible thing and tell the public which pills have the stamp made by this manufacturer. People are going to take the drug anyway whether you identify the stamp or not so let these kids know how it's stamped so they are aware and prevent these deaths!</p>
<p>joe canada said</p>
<p>we need alot harsher sentences for the people manufacturing and distributing this stuff. Years ago parents worried about children smoking some grass, now that is nothing compared to some drugs readily available on the streets today.</p>
<p>Sylvie in Ottawa said</p>
<p>Kevin: if people were dying after consuming one shot of alcohol, you would be screaming for the government to step in and regulate the liquor industry and for the cops to crack down on illegal distillers.Ecstasy is manufactured by people who are criminals who may have dropped out of high school. I wouldn't trust them to mix dangerous chemicals that may kill me.</p>
<p>DaveT said</p>
<p>I think all drugs including booze are very dangerous and @ Kevin it's not a waste of time when kids are dying maybe just maybe this article might stop one person from taking a pill. so no message about drugs killing people especially kids is a waste of time....But booze is just as bad and that i agree with you on...Get the ads off Tv stop making it the thing to do grow up and drink ..Not Cool !!</p>
<p>Dixie from Alberta said</p>
<p>What the H is wrong with young people popping pills that were made in someone's kitchen? Don't know what's in them ....but hey... it might make me high...no problem. Just can't understand the mind set of those who do drugs. Your life is the most precious thing you have..don't destroy it.</p>
<p>Rosebud said</p>
<p>Yes Kevin but that is the person themselves that do that. This drug is not controlled by anyone but the dealers and makers of the drug and they don't care about the dangers just the money they make from it. There should be a program in the schools so the teens can learn why drugs are needed to save lives and show the ones that don't.</p>
<p>Kevin said</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how many people did alcohol kill in the same time period?Come on guys, stop wasting taxpayer money on this stuff.</p>
