<p>LONDON: Want to shed the flab? Eat from a red plate and drink from a red cup, recommends a new study. German and Swiss academics claim that using a red plate stops people from eating as much food and using red cups also stops pub-goers from drinking too much alcohol - in fact, it helps reduce food and drinks consumption by 40%.</p>
<p>They said the colour red may encourage diners to avoid snacking because it is commonly associated with the idea of "danger, prohibition and stop" , the Daily Mail reported.</p>
<p>The findings mean the government and food industry could start using red packaging on unhealthy foods as a deterrent - and could even use more red in pubs to prevent people drinking too much.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers recruited 41 male students who were asked to drink tea from cups marked with red or blue labels. The subjects drank 44% less from cups with red labels.</p>
<p>In the second part, 109 people were given 10 pretzels each on either a red, blue or white plate. Those with a red plate ate fewer pretzels, say the researchers . Ursula Arens at the British Dietetic Association said, "Red may be associated with alarm or something primeval."</p>
