<p>THE identity of the island&#8217;s new breast care surgeon has been revealed. Ms Millie Bello will take on the permanent post as of February 1 and brings with her impeccable credentials and a massive amount of expertise in the area. Ms Bello’s official title is consultant general surgeon with a special interest in oncoplastic breast surgery and breast care. In reality this means she is a breast care specialist who will be able to develop the island’s breast care service while providing vital general surgery on-call cover. Her appointment, plus plans to develop the service, means many women who would have had to travel off-island for treatment will no longer have to do so. She and her team at Noble’s Hospital will be charged with offering a wider range of enchanced services on-island, including oncoplastic breast surgery, sentinel node biopsy, immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, symmetrisation surgery and aesthetic breast reconstruction. Ms Bello, who has been a consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery for 10 years in the UK, has spent the last six-and-a-half years working at Nottingham University Hospital’s Breast Institute, a centre of excellence in the provision of breast care services. ‘I am very excited about coming to the Isle of Man,’ she said. ‘I’ve already made a number of visits and the island offers an excellent quality of life. The community seems very friendly and I’ve already been made to feel welcome. I’m very much looking forward to working with colleagues to develop the island’s breast care service, ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care possible.’ Email to a friend Print this page Comments There are 3 comments to this article Order by: Newest first | Oldest first Page 1 of 1 1 Show all 3 Catty Thursday, January 12, 2012 at 08:57 AM Try telling my missus (a nurse of almost 30 years) that the NHS works 9 - 5. Actually, don't, especially after a 12 hour shift with no breaks! Report Unsuitable | --> 2 SJR Wednesday, January 11, 2012 at 07:25 PM Anyone who finds a lump on their breast should be immediately scanned for piece of mind.Never mind waiting for weeks for an appointment with all the worry involved.If that means the scanner being used 247 then sobeit.The waiting list would soon be slashed and people could get on with their lives.The way the NHS works 9-5 is a disgrace. Report Unsuitable | --> 1 mariamaria Wednesday, January 11, 2012 at 06:44 PM Good news indeed, now we have a competent breast surgeon who also is qualified to do general surgery, a good result. I am so glad Brenda Cannell and her protesters did not manage to blackmail the last Health Minister with their ridiculous demands on a very emotive subject. I am a surviving, at the moment, breast cancer patient and am grateful for the care I have experienced, but realise it would not have been sensible or cost effective to have a surgeon who only dealt with this one aspect of care. As a small Island the number of breast cancer patients do not justify this position. I hope Ms Bello enjoys the beneifits of living on such a beautiful Island and she is made very welcome.</p>
