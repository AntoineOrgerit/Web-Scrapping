Assisted death plan is risky, admits Falconer who says no system could be &#039;completely watertight&#039; (dailymail.co.uk, 06 January 2012) Money — not morals — fuels the suicide lobby (£, thesundaytimes.co.uk, 8 January 2012) ‘Biased’ assisted suicide report under fire from critics (5 January 2012) ‘Cheerleading’ BBC to show an assisted suicide on TV (15 April 2011) Wednesday, 11 January 2012 Share Wed, 11 Jan 2012 A contentious plan which would allow terminally ill people to undergo an assisted suicide is not without risk, its own chief architect has admitted. Last week Lord Falconer&#8217;s Commission on Assisted Dying released a report saying that adults thought to have less than a year to live should be able to ask doctors for drugs which would end their life. The report faced widespread criticism with opponents casting doubt on its impartiality. Euthanasia Lord Falconer, the Commission’s chairman, has admitted the plan is not perfect, saying: “I don’t think you can ever have a system that is completely watertight.” Dominic Lawson, writing in The Sunday Times, has drawn a link between the “unprecedented vigour of the voluntary euthanasia movement and the growing panic over the state&#8217;s ability to fund the care bill for the nation’s geriatrics”.
