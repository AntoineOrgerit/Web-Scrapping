York police said they received an anonymous tip in June about the suspect, accusing him of not disclosing his medical condition prior to having sex with women. Police said they identified a victim by October and that allowed them to build a case alleging that he had sexual relations without disclosing he is HIV-positive. The suspect was arrested without incident on Tuesday. Now investigators want to know if there are other victims who haven&rsquo;t come forward. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sexual Assault Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7071. Sarbjit Singh Mann, 39, is charged with aggravated sexual assault and criminal negligence.
