<p>Claire Osborn (Pic: SWNS) A mum accidentally saved her own life by coughing up a cancer tumour &#8211; and was congratulated by a doctor on her good fortune. Claire Osborn, 37, felt a tickle in her throat seconds before she hacked up a 2cm wide heart-shaped lump into a tissue. She took the growth to her doctor and a biopsy revealed it was an aggressive throat cancer. The mum of six was initially given a 50% chance of survival. But further tests revealed there was no trace of any other cancer. Advertisement >> Doctors believe the tumour grew on a stalk at the back of her throat and the coughing dislodged it. Claire said: &#8220;The consultant said: &#8216;It appears you have coughed up your cancer. Congratulations.&#8217; I was totally flabbergasted, a coughing fit had saved my life.&#8221; Claire felt a scratching sensation in her throat on October 11 last year and after five minutes&#8217; coughing, she felt &#8220;something dislodge&#8221; and fly out of her mouth. She said: &#8220;It looked like a strip of liver. I threw it away. The next day the same thing happened but this time the lump was much bigger. I knew something was very wrong so I went straight to my GP who sent the tissue sample away for tests.&#8221; Claire and husband Kevin, 53, of Coventry, went on holiday and medics confirmed the sample was malignant on their return. She said: &#8220;I was devastated. I just thought I was going to die so I started saving for my funeral.&#8221; But a scan at University Hospital Coventry came back negative. She needed only a minor operation to remove cancerous tongue cells. Her surgeon Gary Walton said: &#8220;It is very uncommon to cough up cancer, but she did it.&#8221;</p>
