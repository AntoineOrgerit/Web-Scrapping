<p>Fans of Elton John , below, will have to wait a little longer for his memoir of sex, drugs and rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll. But his publisher is expected to announce Monday that Mr. John, 64, has signed up to write his first book, about his experience in fighting AIDS. The book, titled &ldquo;Love Is the Cure,&rdquo; will be &ldquo;the very personal stories of Sir Elton&rsquo;s life during the AIDS epidemic, including his agony at seeing friend after friend perish needlessly,&rdquo; said his publisher, Little, Brown & Company. Mr. John had long wondered why greater effort was not made to cure the disease. &ldquo;Why are we not doing more?&rdquo; he wrote in an e-mail from his publisher. &ldquo;This is a question I have thought deeply about, and wish to answer &mdash; and to help change &mdash; by writing this book.&rdquo; Mr. John, a longtime AIDS activist, founded the Elton John Aids Foundation in 1992. Michael Pietsch , the publisher of Little, Brown, will edit the book, to be released in July. A number of musicians, including Keith Richards , Patti Smith , Pete Townshend and Sammy Hagar , have lined up in recent years to write memoirs. Robert Barnett , the Washington lawyer who represented Mr. John in the deal, said that Mr. John had no such plans. A version of this brief appeared in print on January 9, 2012, on page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Publisher Has Deal For Elton John Book.</p>
