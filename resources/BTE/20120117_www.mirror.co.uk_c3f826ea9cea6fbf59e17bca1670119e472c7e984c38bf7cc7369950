<p>A disabled businessman has been thrown off a budget flight &#8211; because he could not walk to the emergency exit. EasyJet staff told Dr Martin Sabry, 39, who is paralysed from the chest down, that he could not travel on his own. He said ground control told him he could board the plane, but the captain over-ruled the decision and he was told all single passengers must be able to reach the exit.

He said yesterday: &#8220;It was so demeaning and unbelievable the way they treated me and the purser was obnoxiously rude.&#8221; Dr Sabry, from Cambridge, waited four hours to speak to bosses, who apologised, put him on the next flight from Gatwick to Toulouse and paid for his taxi transfer. A spokeswoman said: &#8220;All passengers travelling alone must be able to make their way to an exit unaided &#8211; it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding this.&#8221;</p>
