<p>ABC News&#8217; Ben Waldron reports: A Bronx man says he nearly had an asthma attack after opening his mail to find a $44 million medical bill from a local hospital. Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez, 28, received the astronomical bill after receiving successful treatment for pneumonia at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital last week, The New York Daily News reports . &#8220;I almost had an asthma attack,&#8221; said Rodriguez, who apparently is not the only patient to receive an outsized bill. The firm responsible for the botched billing, PHY Services, was reportedly inundated with complaints and has since apologized. &#8220;If you are calling with respect the billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement,&#8221; said a recording for concerned callers, &#8220;you will be receiving a new statement shortly.&#8221; PHY is blaming the mistake on a &#8220;system error&#8221; that resulted in the bill&#8217;s invoice number being mistakenly placed in the &#8220;amount due&#8221; field. As for Rodriguez, he owes no more than $300 for outpatient services. Email 9 Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print Previous New Member of the Royal Family?

Posted by: Nothing new ! | January 16, 2012, 7:28 am 7:28 am Man &#8211; hospitals are out of control with their prices. How will anyone be able to pay these ridiculous bills? More and more are uninsured because their companies cannot afford healthcare and those that have it find that it is unsatisfactory in many ways. Co-insurance and deductibles are squeezing consumers who can barely afford their mortgages or rents let alone $3,000 and up yearly deductibles. Romney wants to appeal Obamacare but premiums will end up going up 25% in that case. The free market is clearly not a solution and healthcare is quickly becoming rationed. The US is broke. We need to do something quickly.

This amounts to a company’s recklessness manifested in many levels of management – for one &#8211; It appeared that the company hired poor-quality software engineer(s) and the embarrassing result shown in media limelight. And I know what I’m talking about because I’ve more than 30 years of programming and working experience to back it up. Posted by: Get_Down | January 16, 2012, 9:30 am 9:30 am Guys, this was a billing error, nothing more. &#8220;PHY is blaming the mistake on a “system error” that resulted in the bill’s invoice number being mistakenly placed in the “amount due” field.&#8221; Posted by: A Cynic | January 16, 2012, 9:31 am 9:31 am It only cost Steve Austin $6 millions and he got super power out of it. Posted by: titan2005 | January 16, 2012, 11:57 am 11:57 am The problem could be software related or PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between the Keyboard And Chair) related due to the user. I have written medical form software in the past. Medical forms in software need to be beyond bullet-proof and the QA team needs to try as many crazy combinations or errors as possible. Even then, sometimes bad data passes through the software to the system. One example was when a health insurance client asked why there was apparently unrelated text in the notes field of a medical form. The problem was that the agent copy and pasted an Olive Garden recipe from a web browser into the notes field in the medical form. Since the client asked about the details of the text and the recipe was incomplete, I sent the URL to the recipe and the full description of the recipe to the client. :-) Posted by: Bald_Flyboy | January 16, 2012, 11:59 am 11:59 am if they bill you or the insurance companies this munch, it can be easily raise question and found that is is an error from human or system. imagine that you are fully taken care by your government for the care and the bill is sent to uncle sam, who is going to audit all this types of transactions ? if a human makes error, the system can catch it; if a system makes error, the human can catch it; but if both human AND system make error by design, who is going to audit and catch it ??? that is one of the real reason that is why prices, premiums, and taxes are never enough ! if it can happen to you, it can happen to others; and vice versa, if it happen to others, it can happen to you too. in a free market where competitions exist, one has the right to choose and to buy; but in a control market where only limited stuffs exist, one has to pay more monetarily and rights ! Posted by: human vs system | January 16, 2012, 12:43 pm 12:43 pm Was this a mistake? I have heard of more and more companies overbilling, and then apologizing and setting the bill right after being &#8220;caught.&#8221; There has to be a number of others, probably elderly, who don&#8217;t notice the change, and end up paying the amount. This could be yet one more way of deceiving the public to boost income. It could be yet one more scheme to defraud the public without anyone watching, without any consequences.
