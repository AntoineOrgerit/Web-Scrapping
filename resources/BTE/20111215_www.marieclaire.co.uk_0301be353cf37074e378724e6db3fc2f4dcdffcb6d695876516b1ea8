<p>Sorry to burst your bubble but according to a study of 2,000 women, the Mr Perfect we&#039;re all looking for doesn&#039;t exist. Most women ranked their partner as only 69 per cent &#039;perfect&#039;, citing their partners&#039; failure to make an effort with their partner&#039;s friends, inability to do more than one thing at a time and poor personal grooming as the most common flaws. &#039;It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner ,&#039; says Nikki McReynolds, marketing director at Remington , which commissioned the study. &#039;While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won&#039;t get away with.&#039; The poll found that women look for a good personality, a sense of humour and good looks, while dodgy dancing, leaving clothes lying around on the bedroom floor and snoring are sure signs of imperfection . One in five women would forgive leaving the toilet seat up and a lack of culinary skills but men using their girlfriend&#039;s toothbrush and not listening were sure fire ways to lose &#039;perfect&#039; points. &#039;The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of David Beckham , but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference,&#039; says Miss McReynolds.
