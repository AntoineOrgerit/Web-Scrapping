<p>Sneaky health chiefs have ordered doctors to pick out services for privatisation. The Government has sent a letter to all primary care trusts demanding they identify at least three services that can be handed to the private sector. Labour says the move is further evidence of Tory plans to privatise the NHS by stealth and accused David Cameron of breaking his pledge to keep the NHS in public ownership. Advertisement >> The letter from Dame Barbara Hakin, commissioning chief at the Department of Health, says primary care trusts should work with new GP commissioning groups on ways they can extend &#8220;choice of provider&#8221;. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham will today lead a Commons debate to try to halt the Tory reforms. Speaking about the letter, which was sent to trusts in July last year, Mr Burnham said: &#8220;We have learnt from bitter experience not to trust the Prime Minister&#8217;s NHS pledges. &#8220;Just two months after promising that there would be no privatisation of the health service, his Government outrageously orders the privatisation of three local services.&#8221; A Department of Health source said allowing &#8220;new, high quality organisations&#8221; to provide services to NHS patients would drive up standards. nhs , privatisation Related articles Mum takes son to Germany after being 'let down' by UK cancer care 11/01/2012 00:00 Tory cuts causing delays in cancer care, Mirror probe reveals 11/01/2012 00:00 Cancer mum 'dying after NHS chiefs failed to stump up cash for treatment' 09/01/2012 00:00 NHS Choices website visits rocket 50% 31/12/2011 00:00 Robert Winston attacks high cost of IVF treatment</p>
