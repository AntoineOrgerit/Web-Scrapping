<p>Restaurants, takeaways and even supermarkets could face a maximum &#163;1,000 fine if they fail to display their scores on the doors. The Welsh Government will today publish proposals to force all food businesses to publicise their food hygiene rating on their premises. If the legislation is passed, Wales will become the first country to introduce a mandatory display scheme &#8211; and it could be in place by 2014. Health Minister Lesley Griffiths said the legislation will help to improve food hygiene across Wales and would be "good for business". It comes in the wake of the 2005 E.coli O157 outbreak, which killed Mason Jones and affected more than 150 others across the South Wales Valleys. Mrs Griffiths, who will launch a three-month consultation into the proposals today in Llandudno, said: &#8220;I believe food hygiene is vital for the protection of public health, and this scheme will help drive up standards and benefit consumers and businesses alike. &#8220;The scheme will enable consumers to make a more informed choice about where they choose to eat or shop for food. &#8220;Mandatory display of hygiene scores will also benefit food businesses. Good food hygiene means a good rating, which is good for business. &#8220;Professor Hugh Pennington, who chaired the public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli outbreak supports such a scheme as an inexpensive way of driving significant improvements in food safety.&#8221; Food business, including restaurants, takeaways, school and hospital canteens, are awarded a food hygiene rating of between zero and five based on their regular environmental health inspections. A rating of zero means urgent improvement is necessary; a five means a business has very good hygiene standards. The ratings were launched in October 2010 and are available online. Some businesses, usually those with a rating of three (generally satisfactory) or more, chose to display their ratings on their premises. Under the proposals, businesses which do not display their hygiene rating could be hit with a &#163;200 fixed penalty notice fine and a maximum fine of &#163;1,000 if prosecuted. The consultation document, which is published today, says the mandatory scheme would apply to all places where people eat out and where they buy their food from, including supermarkets, delicatessens and bakeries. It is thought 30,000 businesses in Wales would be covered by the scheme. Currently more than 13,500 have been rated under the voluntary scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency. Julie Barratt, director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health in Wales, said: &#8220;We think this is a marvellous idea and believe it is important for the public to be able to make informed choices about where they eat. &#8220;The publication of a hygiene score on the door means people can make appropriate choices and it will also drive up standards &#8211; if a one-rated business is next door to a five-rated business, the public will chose the five, meaning the other will have to up its game.&#8221; Maria Battle, senior director of Consumer Focus Wales, which has campaigned for a mandatory scheme, said: &#8220;The overwhelming majority of people in Wales have told us they want a simple and transparent food hygiene standards system with mandatory display of food hygiene ratings. &#8220;They also said they want to be able to download inspection reports from the food hygiene rating scheme website, while more than half of people told us they want to simply pick up the phone or write to their local council to obtain the information. &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased a question on the public availability of inspection reports has been asked as part of the consultation. &#8220;We also welcome on-the-spot penalties to deal with any food businesses that are unhappy about displaying poor ratings on their premises. Similar schemes that ran in New York and Toronto have been successful and helped to deter businesses from non-display in the first place and drove up standards.&#8221; Health Minister Lesley Griffiths explains why the Welsh Government wants to become the first in the UK to force food businesses to display their hygiene scores on their doors Related Tags e.coli , food hygiene scores , food poisoning , lesley griffiths (What's this) Related Stories Food hygiene ratings are "good for business" says Health Minister Lesley Griffiths Dec 14 2011 Top 300: Health Editor Madeleine Brindley examines why the health service needs to change Dec 14 2011 The Children&#8217;s Hospital of Wales finally receives the funds to complete its "world class" development Dec 13 2011 Children's Hospital for Wales to receive &#163;63.8m funding boost Dec 12 2011 Playgrounds across Wales targeted in new moves to stub out smoking in public Dec 6 2011 Woman 'did not get E.coli infection at Singleton Hospital' Nov 29 2011 Nursery and playgroup will re-open after Bangor E.coli outbreak</p>
